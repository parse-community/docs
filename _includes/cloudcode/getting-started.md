# Getting Started

Cloud Code is [built into Parse Server]({{ site.baseUrl }}/parse-server/guide/). The default entry point for your Cloud Code is at `./cloud/main.js`.

## What is Cloud Code?

For complex apps, sometimes you just need a bit of logic that isn't running on a mobile device. Cloud Code makes this possible.

Cloud Code is easy to use because it's built on the same JavaScript SDK that powers thousands of apps. The only difference is that this code runs in your Parse Server rather than running on the user's mobile device. When you update your Cloud Code, it becomes available to all mobile environments instantly. You don't have to wait for a new release of your application. This lets you change app behavior on the fly and add new features faster.

Even if you're only familiar with mobile development, we hope you'll find Cloud Code straightforward and easy to use.
