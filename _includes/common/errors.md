# Error Codes

The following is a list of all the error codes that can be returned by the Parse API. You may also refer to [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) for a list of http error codes. Make sure to check the error message for more details.

## API Issues

| Name                             | Code | Description                                                   |
|----------------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UserInvalidLoginParams`	       |  101 | Invalid login parameters. Check error message for more details.                           |
| `ObjectNotFound`	               |  101 | The specified object or session doesn't exist or could not be found. Can also indicate that you do not have the necessary permissions to read or write this object. Check error message for more details.                           |
| `InvalidQuery`	                 |  102 | There is a problem with the parameters used to construct this query. This could be an invalid field name or an invalid field type for a specific constraint. Check error message for more details.  |
| `InvalidClassName`               |  103 | Missing or invalid classname. Classnames are case-sensitive. They must start with a letter, and a-zA-Z0-9_ are the only valid characters. |

| `InvalidFieldName`	             |  105 | An invalid field name. Keys are case-sensitive. They must start with a letter, and a-zA-Z0-9_ are the only valid characters. Some field names may be reserved. Check error message for more details. |
| `InvalidPointer`	               |  106 | A malformed pointer was used. You would typically only see this if you have modified a client SDK. |
| `InvalidJSON`                    |  107 | Badly formed JSON was received upstream. This either indicates you have done something unusual with modifying how things encode to JSON, or the network is failing badly. Can also indicate an invalid utf-8 string or use of multiple form encoded values. Check error message for more details.  |
| `CommandUnavailable`	           |  108 | The feature you tried to access is only available internally for testing purposes. |
| `NotInitialized`	               |  109 | You must call Parse.initialize before using the Parse library. Check the Quick Start guide for your platform. |
| `ObjectTooLarge`	               |  116 | The object is too large. Parse Objects have a max size of 128 kilobytes. |
| `ExceededConfigParamsError`      |  116 | You have reached the limit of 100 config parameters. |
| `InvalidLimitError`	             |  117 | An invalid value was set for the limit. Check error message for more details. |
| `InvalidSkipError`	             |  118 | An invalid value was set for skip. Check error message for more details. |
| `OperationForbidden`	           |  119 | The operation isn't allowed for clients due to class-level permissions. Check error message for more details. |

| `SuccessErrorNotCalled`          |  141 | success/error was not called. A cloud function will return once response.success() or response.error() is called. A background job will similarly finish execution once status.success() or status.error() is called. If a function or job never reaches either of the success/error methods, this error will be returned. This may happen when a function does not handle an error response correctly, preventing code execution from reaching the success() method call. |
| `MultupleSuccessErrorCalls`      |  141 | Can't call success/error multiple times. A cloud function will return once response.success() or response.error() is called. A background job will similarly finish execution once status.success() or status.error() is called.
