# Sample App

We prepared a [sample app](https://github.com/parse-community/Anydevice) that demonstrates how to provision connected devices using a companion phone app such that connected devices can securely access user-specific data on the Parse Cloud. This sample app also demonstrates how to send push notifications between the phone app and connected devices.
