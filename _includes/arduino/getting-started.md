⚠️ The [Arduino SDK](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-SDK-Android/tree/1.20.0) has been retired due to a lack of contribution and use. If you intent to continue using this SDK you can still fork the repo. If you are interested in maintaining it please make yourself known and we would be happy to unarchive it.

# Getting Started

If you haven't installed the SDK yet, please [head over to the Arduino SDK repository](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-SDK-Arduino) to install the SDK in the Arduino IDE. Note that this SDK requires the Arduino Yún and the Arduino IDE v1.6.0+.

The Parse platform provides a complete backend solution for your hardware device. Our goal is to totally eliminate the need for writing server code or maintaining servers.

Note that the Arduino SDK only contains a subset of Parse features found in mobile and desktop. This allows the SDK to be smaller in size and more performant, making it suitable for constrained embedded environments. The Arduino SDK is fully open source, and anyone can contribute to make it better, or make their own changes if necessary. Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-embedded-sdks) for more information.

## Initialization

In order for Parse to know which app is associated with the Arduino device, simply specify the application ID and client key in your `setup` function:

```cpp
void setup() {
	Parse.begin("${APPLICATION_ID}", "${CLIENT_KEY}");
	// ...
}
```

After this, all calls to the Parse Server will use the specified app.

In order for the Arduino device to know where the Parse server is located, specify the URL in your `setup` function:

```cpp
void setup() {
	Parse.begin("${APPLICATION_ID}", "${CLIENT_KEY}");
	Parse.setServerURL("parseapi.back4app.com");
	// ...
}
```

When the Arduino attempts to connect to the Parse server, it will need to know whether or not to connect using SSL.  It is recommended to use SSL whenever possible.

Option 1: SSL

SSL requires that the Arduino knows the server fingerprint.  The server fingerprint can be found using the Chrome browser.  Browse the secure server URL, press `ctrl+shift+i`, select `security` tab, click `view certificate`, and get the thumbprint from the `details` tab.  Specify this as well in your `setup` function:

```cpp
void setup() {
	Parse.begin("${APPLICATION_ID}", "${CLIENT_KEY}");
	Parse.setServerURL("parseapi.back4app.com");
	Parse.setHostFingerprint("${HOST_THUMBPRINT}");
	// ...
}
```

Option 2: Insecure

The Arduino can connect to Parse over an insecure connection if desired, but must be specified in your setup function:

```cpp
void setup() {
	Parse.begin("${APPLICATION_ID}", "${CLIENT_KEY}");
	Parse.setServerURL("parseapi.back4app.com");
	Parse.setClientInsecure();
	// ...
}
```

Parse is now initialized and ready to make calls to the Parse server.
