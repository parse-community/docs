                        <p>Android Guide</p>

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<p>If you haven’t installed the SDK yet, please <a href="/apps/quickstart#parse_data/mobile/android/native/new">head over to the QuickStart guide</a> to get our SDK up and running in Android Studio. Note that we support Android 2.3 and higher. You can also check out our <a href="/docs/android/api/">API Reference</a> for more detailed information about our SDK.</p>

<p>The Parse platform provides a complete backend solution for your mobile application. Our goal is to totally eliminate the need for writing server code or maintaining servers. If you’re familiar with web frameworks like Ruby on Rails, we’ve taken many of the same principles and applied them to our platform. In particular, our SDK is ready to use out of the box with minimal configuration on your part.</p>

<p>On Parse, you create an App for each of your mobile applications. Each App has its own application id and client key that you apply to your SDK install. Your account on Parse can accommodate multiple Apps. This is useful even if you have one application, since you can deploy different versions for test and production.</p>

<h1 id="objects">Objects</h1>

<h2 id="the-parseobject">The ParseObject</h2>

<p>Storing data on Parse is built around the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>. Each <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> contains key-value pairs of JSON-compatible data. This data is schemaless, which means that you don’t need to specify ahead of time what keys exist on each <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>. You simply set whatever key-value pairs you want, and our backend will store it.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say you’re tracking high scores for a game. A single <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> could contain:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">score</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="mi">1337</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">playerName</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s2">"Sean Plott"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">cheatMode</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Keys must be alphanumeric strings. Values can be strings, numbers, booleans, or even arrays and objects - anything that can be JSON-encoded.</p>

<p>Each <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> has a class name that you can use to distinguish different sorts of data. For example, we could call the high score object a <code class="highlighter-rouge">GameScore</code>. We recommend that you NameYourClassesLikeThis and nameYourKeysLikeThis, just to keep your code looking pretty.</p>

<h2 id="saving-objects">Saving Objects</h2>

<p>Let’s say you want to save the <code class="highlighter-rouge">GameScore</code> described above to the Parse Cloud. The interface is similar to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Map</code>, plus the <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveInBackground</code> method:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">gameScore</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"score"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">1337</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"playerName"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Sean Plott"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"cheatMode"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>After this code runs, you will probably be wondering if anything really happened. To make sure the data was saved, you can look at the Data Browser in your app on Parse. You should see something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">objectId</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s2">"xWMyZ4YEGZ"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">score</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="mi">1337</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">playerName</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s2">"Sean Plott"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">cheatMode</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="nx">createdAt</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="s2">"2011-06-10T18:33:42Z"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">updatedAt</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="s2">"2011-06-10T18:33:42Z"</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There are two things to note here. You didn’t have to configure or set up a new Class called <code class="highlighter-rouge">GameScore</code> before running this code. Your Parse app lazily creates this Class for you when it first encounters it.</p>

<p>There are also a few fields you don’t need to specify that are provided as a convenience. <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectId</code> is a unique identifier for each saved object. <code class="highlighter-rouge">createdAt</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">updatedAt</code> represent the time that each object was created and last modified in the cloud. Each of these fields is filled in by Parse, so they don’t exist on a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> until a save operation has completed.</p>

<h2 id="retrieving-objects">Retrieving Objects</h2>

<p>Saving data to the cloud is fun, but it’s even more fun to get that data out again. If you have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectId</code>, you can retrieve the whole <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> using a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"xWMyZ4YEGZ"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">GetCallback</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">object</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// object will be your game score</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// something went wrong</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To get the values out of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, there’s a <code class="highlighter-rouge">getX</code> method for each data type:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">score</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getInt</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"score"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">playerName</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getString</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"playerName"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="n">cheatMode</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getBoolean</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"cheatMode"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you don’t know what type of data you’re getting out, you can call <code class="highlighter-rouge">get(key)</code>, but then you probably have to cast it right away anyways. In most situations you should use the typed accessors like <code class="highlighter-rouge">getString</code>.</p>

<p>The three special values have their own accessors:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">objectId</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getObjectId</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">Date</span> <span class="n">updatedAt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getUpdatedAt</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">Date</span> <span class="n">createdAt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCreatedAt</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you need to refresh an object you already have with the latest data that
    is in the cloud, you can call the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fetchInBackground</code> method like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">myObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">fetchInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">GetCallback</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">object</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// Success!</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// Failure!</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The code in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">GetCallback</code> will be run on the main thread.</p>

<h2 id="the-local-datastore">The Local Datastore</h2>

<p>Parse also lets you store objects in a <a href="#local-datastore">local datastore</a> on the Android device itself. You can use this for data that doesn’t need to be saved to the cloud, but this is especially useful for temporarily storing data so that it can be synced later. To enable the datastore, call <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.enableLocalDatastore()</code> in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Application</code> constructor before calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.initialize()</code>. Once the local datastore is enabled, you can store an object by pinning it.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">gameScore</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"score"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">1337</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"playerName"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Sean Plott"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"cheatMode"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">pinInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As with saving, this recursively stores every object and file that <code class="highlighter-rouge">gameScore</code> points to, if it has been fetched from the cloud. Whenever you save changes to the object, or fetch new changes from Parse, the copy in the datastore will be automatically updated, so you don’t have to worry about it.</p>

<h2 id="retrieving-objects-from-the-local-datastore">Retrieving Objects from the Local Datastore</h2>

<p>Storing an object is only useful if you can get it back out. To get the data for a specific object, you can use a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> just like you would while on the network, but using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fromLocalDatastore</code> method to tell it where to get the data.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">);</span>

  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you already have an instance of the object, you can instead use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fetchFromLocalDatastoreInBackground</code> method.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">object</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">createWithoutData</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"xWMyZ4YEGZ"</span><span class="o">);</span>

  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="unpinning-objects">Unpinning Objects</h2>

<p>When you are done with the object and no longer need to keep it on the device, you can release it with <code class="highlighter-rouge">unpinInBackground</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">unpinInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="saving-objects-offline">Saving Objects Offline</h2>

<p>Most save functions execute immediately, and inform your app when the save is complete. If you don’t need to know when the save has finished, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveEventually</code> instead. The advantage is that if the user currently doesn’t have a network connection, <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveEventually</code> will store the update on the device until a network connection is re-established. If your app is closed before the connection is back, Parse will try again the next time the app is opened. All calls to <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveEventually</code> (and <code class="highlighter-rouge">deleteEventually</code>) are executed in the order they are called, so it is safe to call <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveEventually</code> on an object multiple times. If you have the local datastore enabled, then any object you <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveEventually</code> will be pinned as long as that save is in progress. That makes it easy to retrieve your local changes while waiting for the network to be available.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">gameScore</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">);</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="updating-objects">Updating Objects</h2>

<p>Updating an object is simple. Just set some new data on it and call one of the save methods. Assuming you have saved the object and have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectId</code>, you can retrieve the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> using a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> and update its data:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="c1">// Retrieve the object by id</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"xWMyZ4YEGZ"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">GetCallback</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

      <span class="c1">// Now let's update it with some new data. In this case, only cheatMode and score</span>
      <span class="c1">// will get sent to the Parse Cloud. playerName hasn't changed.</span>

      <span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"cheatMode"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
      <span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Parse automatically figures out which data has changed so only “dirty” fields will be transmitted during a save. You don’t need to worry about squashing data in the cloud that you didn’t intend to update.</p>

<h2 id="counters">Counters</h2>

<p>The above example contains a common use case. The “score” field is a counter that we’ll need to continually update with the player’s latest score. Using the above method works but it’s cumbersome and can lead to problems if you have multiple clients trying to update the same counter.</p>

<p>To help with storing counter-type data, Parse provides methods that atomically increment (or decrement) any number field. So, the same update can be rewritten as:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">increment</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"score"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also increment by any amount using <code class="highlighter-rouge">increment(key, amount)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="arrays">Arrays</h2>

<p>To help with storing array data, there are three operations that can be used to atomically change an array field:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">add</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">addAll</code> append the given objects to the end of an array field.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">addUnique</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">addAllUnique</code> add only the given objects which aren’t already contained in an array field to that field. The position of the insert is not guaranteed.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">removeAll</code> removes all instances of the given objects from an array field.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, we can add items to the set-like “skills” field like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addAllUnique</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"skills"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Arrays</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">asList</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"flying"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"kungfu"</span><span class="o">));</span>
<span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that it is not currently possible to atomically add and remove items from an array in the same save. You will have to call <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code> in between every different kind of array operation.</p>

<h2 id="deleting-objects">Deleting Objects</h2>

<p>To delete an object from the Parse Cloud:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">myObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">deleteInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to run a callback when the delete is confirmed, you can provide a <code class="highlighter-rouge">DeleteCallback</code> to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">deleteInBackground</code> method. If you want to block the calling thread, you can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">delete</code> method.</p>

<p>You can delete a single field from an object with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">remove</code> method:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// After this, the playerName field will be empty</span>
<span class="n">myObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">remove</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"playerName"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="c1">// Saves the field deletion to the Parse Cloud</span>
<span class="n">myObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="relational-data">Relational Data</h2>

<p>Objects can have relationships with other objects. To model this behavior, any <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> can be used as a value in other <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>s. Internally, the Parse framework will store the referred-to object in just one place, to maintain consistency.</p>

<p>For example, each <code class="highlighter-rouge">Comment</code> in a blogging app might correspond to one <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code>. To create a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> with a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">Comment</code>, you could write:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Create the post</span>
<span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">myPost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Post"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">myPost</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"title"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"I'm Hungry"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">myPost</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"content"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Where should we go for lunch?"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="c1">// Add a relation between the Post and Comment</span>
<span class="n">myComment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"parent"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">myPost</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="c1">// This will save both myPost and myComment</span>
<span class="n">myComment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also link objects using just their <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectId</code>s like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Add a relation between the Post with objectId "1zEcyElZ80" and the comment</span>
<span class="n">myComment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"parent"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">createWithoutData</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Post"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"1zEcyElZ80"</span><span class="o">));</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>By default, when fetching an object, related <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>s are not fetched.  These objects’ values cannot be retrieved until they have been fetched like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">fetchedComment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"post"</span><span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">fetchIfNeededInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">GetCallback</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
          <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getString</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"title"</span><span class="o">);</span>
          <span class="c1">// Do something with your new title variable</span>
        <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also model a many-to-many relation using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRelation}</code> object.  This works similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">List&lt;ParseObject&gt;</code>, except that you don’t need to download all the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>s in a relation at once.  This allows <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRelation}</code> to scale to many more objects than the <code class="highlighter-rouge">List&lt;ParseObject&gt;</code> approach.  For example, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">User</code> may have many <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code>s that they might like.  In this case, you can store the set of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code>s that a <code class="highlighter-rouge">User</code> likes using <code class="highlighter-rouge">getRelation</code>.  In order to add a post to the list, the code would look something like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseUser</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentUser</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">ParseRelation</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">relation</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getRelation</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"likes"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">relation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">post</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can remove a post from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRelation}</code> with something like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">relation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">remove</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">post</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>By default, the list of objects in this relation are not downloaded.  You can get the list of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code>s by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">findInBackground</code> on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> returned by <code class="highlighter-rouge">getQuery</code>.  The code would look like:</p>

<p>If you want only a subset of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code>s you can add extra constraints to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> returned by <code class="highlighter-rouge">getQuery</code>.  The code would look something like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">relation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="c1">// Add other query constraints.</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>For more details on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code>, please look at the <a href="#queries">query portion of this guide</a>.  A <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRelation}</code> behaves similar to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">List&lt;%{ParseObject}&gt;</code> for querying purposes, so any queries you can do on lists of objects (other than <code class="highlighter-rouge">include</code>) you can do on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRelation}</code>.</p>

<h2 id="data-types">Data Types</h2>

<p>So far we’ve used values with type <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{string}</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{number}</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{bool}</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>. Parse also supports <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{float}</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{date}</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{null}</code>.</p>

<p>You can nest <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{map}</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{array}</code> objects to store more structured data within a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>. Overall, the following types are allowed for each field in your object:</p>

<ul>
  <li>String =&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{string}</code></li>
  <li>Number =&gt; primitive numeric values such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{double}</code>s, <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{long}</code>s, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{float}</code>s</li>
  <li>Bool =&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{bool}</code></li>
  <li>Array =&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{array}</code></li>
  <li>Object =&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{map}</code></li>
  <li>Date =&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{date}</code></li>
  <li>File =&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseFile}</code></li>
  <li>Pointer =&gt; other <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code></li>
  <li>Relation =&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRelation}</code></li>
  <li>Null =&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{null}</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>We do not recommend storing large pieces of binary data like images or documents on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>s should not exceed 128 kilobytes in size. We recommend you use <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseFile}</code>s to store images, documents, and other types of files. You can do so by instantiating a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseFile}</code> object and setting it on a field. See <a href="#files">Files</a> for more details.</p>

<p>For more information about how Parse handles data, check out our documentation on <a href="#data">Data</a>.</p>

<h2 id="subclasses">Subclasses</h2>

<p>Parse is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible. You can access all of your data using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> class and access any field with <code class="highlighter-rouge">get()</code>. In mature codebases, subclasses have many advantages, including terseness, extensibility, and support for autocomplete. Subclassing is completely optional, but can transform this code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">shield</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Armor"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<h3 id="subclassing-parseobject">Subclassing ParseObject</h3>

<p>To create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> subclass:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Declare a subclass which extends <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>.</li>
  <li>Add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">@ParseClassName</code> annotation. Its value should be the string you would pass into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> constructor, and makes all future class name references unnecessary.</li>
  <li>Ensure that your subclass has a public default (i.e. zero-argument) constructor. You must not modify any <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> fields in this constructor.</li>
  <li>Call <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseObject.registerSubclass(YourClass.class)</code> in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Application</code> constructor before calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.initialize()</code>.
The following code sucessfully implements and registers the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Armor</code> subclass of <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>:</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Armor.java</span>

<h3 id="accessors-mutators-and-methods">Accessors, Mutators, and Methods</h3>

<p>Adding methods to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> subclass helps encapsulate logic about the class. You can keep all your logic about a subject in one place rather than using separate classes for business logic and storage/transmission logic.</p>

<p>You can add accessors and mutators for the fields of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> easily. Declare the getter and setter for the field as you normally would, but implement them in terms of <code class="highlighter-rouge">get()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">put()</code>. The following example creates a <code class="highlighter-rouge">displayName</code> field in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Armor</code> class:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Armor.java</span>
<span class="nd">@ParseClassName</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Armor"</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Armor</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">getDisplayName</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">getString</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"displayName"</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">setDisplayName</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"displayName"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can now access the displayName field using <code class="highlighter-rouge">armor.getDisplayName()</code> and assign to it using <code class="highlighter-rouge">armor.setDisplayName("Wooden Sword")</code>. This allows your IDE to provide autocompletion as you develop your app and allows typos to be caught at compile-time.</p>

<p>Accessors and mutators of various types can be easily defined in this manner using the various forms of <code class="highlighter-rouge">get()</code> such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">getInt()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">getParseFile()</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">getMap()</code>.</p>

<p>If you need more complicated logic than simple field access, you can declare your own methods as well:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">takeDamage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">amount</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Decrease the armor's durability and determine whether it has broken</span>
  <span class="n">increment</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"durability"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">amount</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">getDurability</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">setBroken</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="initializing-subclasses">Initializing Subclasses</h3>

<p>You should create new instances of your subclasses using the constructors you have defined. Your subclass must define a public default constructor that does not modify fields of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, which will be used throughout the Parse SDK to create strongly-typed instances of your subclass.</p>

<p>To create a reference to an existing object, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseObject.createWithoutData()</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Armor</span> <span class="n">armorReference</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">createWithoutData</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Armor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">armor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getObjectId</span><span class="o">());</span>
</code></pre>

<h3 id="queries">Queries</h3>

<p>You can get a query for objects of a particular subclass using the static method <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQuery.getQuery()</code>. The following example queries for armors that the user can afford:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Armor</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Armor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="o">);</span>

<h1 id="queries-1">Queries</h1>

<p>We’ve already seen how a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">getInBackground</code> can retrieve a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> from Parse. There are many other ways to retrieve data with <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> - you can retrieve many objects at once, put conditions on the objects you wish to retrieve, cache queries automatically to avoid writing that code yourself, and more.</p>

<h2 id="basic-queries">Basic Queries</h2>

<p>In many cases, <code class="highlighter-rouge">getInBackground</code> isn’t powerful enough to specify which objects you want to retrieve. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> offers different ways to retrieve a list of objects rather than just a single object.</p>

<p>The general pattern is to create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code>, put conditions on it, and then retrieve a <code class="highlighter-rouge">List</code> of matching <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>s using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">findInBackground</code> method with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">FindCallback</code>. For example, to retrieve scores with a particular <code class="highlighter-rouge">playerName</code>, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereEqualTo</code> method to constrain the value for a key:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereEqualTo</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"playerName"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Dan Stemkoski"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">findInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">FindCallback</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

        <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">findInBackground</code> works similarly to <code class="highlighter-rouge">getInBackground</code> in that it assures the network request is done on a background thread, and runs its callback in the main thread.</p>

<h2 id="query-constraints">Query Constraints</h2>

<p>There are several ways to put constraints on the objects found by a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code>. You can filter out objects with a particular key-value pair with <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereNotEqualTo</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereNotEqualTo</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"playerName"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Michael Yabuti"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can give multiple constraints, and objects will only be in the results if they match all of the constraints.  In other words, it’s like an AND of constraints.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereNotEqualTo</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"playerName"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Michael Yabuti"</span><span class="o">);</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can limit the number of results with <code class="highlighter-rouge">setLimit</code>. By default, results are limited to 100, but anything from 1 to 1000 is a valid limit:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setLimit</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">// limit to at most 10 results</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want exactly one result, a more convenient alternative may be to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">getFirst</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">getFirstBackground</code> instead of using <code class="highlighter-rouge">find</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can skip the first results with <code class="highlighter-rouge">setSkip</code>. This can be useful for pagination:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setSkip</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">// skip the first 10 results</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>For sortable types like numbers and strings, you can control the order in which results are returned:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Sorts the results in ascending order by the score field</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">orderByAscending</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"score"</span><span class="o">);</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can add more sort keys to the query as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Sorts the results in ascending order by the score field if the previous sort keys are equal.</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addAscendingOrder</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"score"</span><span class="o">);</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>For sortable types, you can also use comparisons in queries:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Restricts to wins &lt; 50</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereLessThan</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"wins"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">50</span><span class="o">);</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to retrieve objects matching several different values, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereContainedIn</code>, providing a collection of acceptable values. This is often useful to replace multiple queries with a single query. For example, if you want to retrieve scores made by any player in a particular list:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">names</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="s">"Jonathan Walsh"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Dario Wunsch"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Shawn Simon"</span><span class="o">};</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereContainedIn</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"playerName"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Arrays</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">asList</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="o">));</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to retrieve objects that do not match any of several values you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereNotContainedIn</code>, providing an array of acceptable values.  For example, if you want to retrieve scores from players besides those in a list:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">names</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="s">"Jonathan Walsh"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Dario Wunsch"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Shawn Simon"</span><span class="o">};</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereNotContainedIn</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"playerName"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Arrays</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">asList</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="o">));</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to retrieve objects that have a particular key set, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereExists</code>. Conversely, if you want to retrieve objects without a particular key set, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereDoesNotExist</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Finds objects that have the score set</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereExists</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"score"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="c1">// Finds objects that don't have the score set</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereDoesNotExist</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"score"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereMatchesKeyInQuery</code> method to get objects where a key matches the value of a key in a set of objects resulting from another query.  For example, if you have a class containing sports teams and you store a user’s hometown in the user class, you can issue one query to find the list of users whose hometown teams have winning records.  The query would look like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">teamQuery</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Team"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="n">userQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereMatchesKeyInQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"hometown"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"city"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">teamQuery</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">userQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">findInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">FindCallback</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="c1">// results has the list of users with a hometown team with a winning record</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Conversely, to get objects where a key does not match the value of a key in a set of objects resulting from another query, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereDoesNotMatchKeyInQuery</code>. For example, to find users whose hometown teams have losing records:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">losingUserQuery</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">losingUserQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereDoesNotMatchKeyInQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"hometown"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"city"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">teamQuery</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">losingUserQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">findInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">FindCallback</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">results</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// results has the list of users with a hometown team with a losing record</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can restrict the fields returned by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">selectKeys</code> with a collection of keys. To retrieve documents that contain only the <code class="highlighter-rouge">score</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">playerName</code> fields (and also special built-in fields such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectId</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">createdAt</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">updatedAt</code>):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">);</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The remaining fields can be fetched later by calling one of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fetchIfNeeded</code> variants on the returned objects:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">object</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">results</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">);</span>

    <span class="c1">// all fields of the object will now be available here.</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="queries-on-array-values">Queries on Array Values</h2>

<p>If a key contains an array value, you can search for objects where the key’s array value contains 2 by:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Find objects where the array in arrayKey contains the number 2.</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereEqualTo</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"arrayKey"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also search for objects where the key’s array value contains each of the values 2, 3, and 4 with the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Find objects where the array in arrayKey contains all of the numbers 2, 3, and 4.</span>
<span class="n">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>

</div>

<h2 id="queries-on-string-values">Queries on String Values</h2>

<div class="tip info"><div>
  If you're trying to implement a generic search feature, we recommend taking a look at this blog post: <a href="http://blog.parse.com/learn/engineering/implementing-scalable-search-on-a-nosql-backend/">Implementing Scalable Search on a NoSQL Backend</a>.
</div></div>

<p>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereStartsWith</code> to restrict to string values that start with a particular string. Similar to a MySQL LIKE operator, this is indexed so it is efficient for large datasets:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Finds barbecue sauces that start with 'Big Daddy's'.</span>
<span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"BarbecueSauce"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereStartsWith</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Big Daddy's"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The above example will match any <code class="highlighter-rouge">BarbecueSauce</code> objects where the value in the “name” String key starts with “Big Daddy’s”. For example, both “Big Daddy’s” and “Big Daddy’s BBQ” will match, but “big daddy’s” or “BBQ Sauce: Big Daddy’s” will not.</p>

<p>Queries that have regular expression constraints are very expensive. Refer to the <a href="#performance-regular-expressions">Performance Guide</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="relational-queries">Relational Queries</h2>

<p>There are several ways to issue queries for relational data. If you want to retrieve objects where a field matches a particular <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereEqualTo</code> just like for other data types. For example, if each <code class="highlighter-rouge">Comment</code> has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> object in its <code class="highlighter-rouge">post</code> field, you can fetch comments for a particular <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Assume ParseObject myPost was previously created.</span>
<span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Comment"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereEqualTo</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"post"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">myPost</span><span class="o">);</span>

    <span class="c1">// commentList now has the comments for myPost</span>

<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to retrieve objects where a field contains a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> that matches a different query, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereMatchesQuery</code>. Note that the default limit of 100 and maximum limit of 1000 apply to the inner query as well, so with large data sets you may need to construct queries carefully to get the desired behavior. In order to find comments for posts containing images, you can do:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">innerQuery</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Post"</span><span class="o">);</span>

</div>

<p>If you want to retrieve objects where a field contains a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> that does not match a different query, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereDoesNotMatchQuery</code>. In order to find comments for posts without images, you can do:</p>

</div>

<p>In some situations, you want to return multiple types of related objects in one query. You can do this with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">include</code> method. For example, let’s say you are retrieving the last ten comments, and you want to retrieve their related posts at the same time:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Comment"</span><span class="o">);</span>

    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also do multi level includes using dot notation.  If you wanted to include the post for a comment and the post’s author as well you can do:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">include</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"post.author"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can issue a query with multiple fields included by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">include</code> multiple times. This functionality also works with ParseQuery helpers like <code class="highlighter-rouge">getFirst()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">getInBackground()</code>.</p>

<h2 id="querying-the-local-datastore">Querying the Local Datastore</h2>

<p>If you have enabled the local datastore by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.enableLocalDatastore()</code> before your call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.initialize()</code>, then you can also query against the objects stored locally on the device. To do this, call the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fromLocalDatastore</code> method on the query.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">fromLocalDatastore</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">findInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">FindCallback</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

      <span class="c1">// Results were successfully found from the local datastore.</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// There was an error.</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can query from the local datastore using exactly the same kinds of queries you use over the network. The results will include every object that matches the query that’s been pinned to your device. The query even takes into account any changes you’ve made to the object that haven’t yet been saved to the cloud. For example, if you call <code class="highlighter-rouge">deleteEventually</code>, on an object, it will no longer be returned from these queries.</p>

<h2 id="caching-queries">Caching Queries</h2>

<p>It’s often useful to cache the result of a query on a device. This lets you show data when the user’s device is offline, or when the app has just started and network requests have not yet had time to complete. The easiest way to do this is with the local datastore. When you pin objects, you can attach a label to the pin, which lets you manage a group of objects together. For example, to cache the results of the query above, you can call <code class="highlighter-rouge">pinAllInBackground</code> and give it a label.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">TOP_SCORES_LABEL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"topScores"</span><span class="o">;</span>

    <span class="o">});</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now when you do any query with <code class="highlighter-rouge">fromLocalDatastore</code>, these objects will be included in the results if they still match the query.</p>

<p>If you aren’t using the local datastore, you can use the per-query cache for <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> instead. The default query behavior doesn’t use the cache, but you can enable caching with <code class="highlighter-rouge">setCachePolicy</code>. For example, to try the network and then fall back to cached data if the network is not available:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setCachePolicy</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">CachePolicy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">NETWORK_ELSE_CACHE</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">findInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">FindCallback</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">scoreList</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// Results were successfully found, looking first on the</span>
      <span class="c1">// network and then on disk.</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// The network was inaccessible and we have no cached data</span>
      <span class="c1">// for this query.</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Parse provides several different cache policies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">IGNORE_CACHE</code>: The query does not load from the cache or save results to the cache. <code class="highlighter-rouge">IGNORE_CACHE</code> is the default cache policy.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">CACHE_ONLY</code>: The query only loads from the cache, ignoring the network. If there are no cached results, that causes a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseException</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">NETWORK_ONLY</code>: The query does not load from the cache, but it will save results to the cache.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">CACHE_ELSE_NETWORK</code>: The query first tries to load from the cache, but if that fails, it loads results from the network. If neither cache nor network succeed, there is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseException</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">NETWORK_ELSE_CACHE</code>: The query first tries to load from the network, but if that fails, it loads results from the cache. If neither network nor cache succeed, there is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseException</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">CACHE_THEN_NETWORK</code>: The query first loads from the cache, then loads from the network. In this case, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">FindCallback</code> will actually be called twice - first with the cached results, then with the network results. This cache policy can only be used asynchronously with <code class="highlighter-rouge">findInBackground</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to control the cache’s behavior, you can use methods provided in ParseQuery to interact with the cache.  You can do the following operations on the cache:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check to see if there is a cached result for the query with:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">java
boolean isInCache = query.hasCachedResult();
</code></li>
  <li>Remove any cached results for a query with:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">java
query.clearCachedResult();
</code></li>
  <li>Remove cached results for all queries with:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">java
ParseQuery.clearAllCachedResults();
</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Query caching also works with ParseQuery helpers including <code class="highlighter-rouge">getFirst()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">getInBackground()</code>.</p>

<h2 id="counting-objects">Counting Objects</h2>

<p>Caveat: Count queries are rate limited to a maximum of 160 requests per minute.  They can also return inaccurate results for classes with more than 1,000 objects.  Thus, it is preferable to architect your application to avoid this sort of count operation (by using counters, for example.)</p>

<p>If you just need to count how many objects match a query, but you do not need to retrieve all the objects that match, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">count</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">find</code>. For example, to count how many games have been played by a particular player:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">);</span>

      <span class="c1">// The count request succeeded. Log the count</span>
      <span class="n">Log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">d</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"score"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Sean has played "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">" games"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// The request failed</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to block the calling thread, you can also use the synchronous <code class="highlighter-rouge">query.count()</code> method.</p>

<h2 id="compound-queries">Compound Queries</h2>

<p>If you want to find objects that match one of several queries, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQuery.or</code> method to construct a query that is an or of the queries passed in.  For instance if you want to find players who either have a lot of wins or a few wins, you can do:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">lotsOfWins</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Player"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can add additional constraints to the newly created <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> that act as an ‘and’ operator.</p>

<p>Note that we do not, however, support GeoPoint or non-filtering constraints (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereNear</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">withinGeoBox</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">setLimit</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">skip</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">orderBy...</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">include</code>) in the subqueries of the compound query.</p>

<h1 id="users">Users</h1>

<p>At the core of many apps, there is a notion of user accounts that lets users access their information in a secure manner. We provide a specialized user class called <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> that automatically handles much of the functionality required for user account management.</p>

<p>With this class, you’ll be able to add user account functionality in your app.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> is a subclass of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, and has all the same features, such as flexible schema, automatic persistence, and a key value interface. All the methods that are on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> also exist in <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>. The difference is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> has some special additions specific to user accounts.</p>

<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> has several properties that set it apart from <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>username: The username for the user (required).</li>
  <li>password: The password for the user (required on signup).</li>
  <li>email: The email address for the user (optional).</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll go through each of these in detail as we run through the various use cases for users. Keep in mind that if you set <code class="highlighter-rouge">username</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">email</code> using the setters, you do not need to set it using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">put</code> method.</p>

<h2 id="signing-up">Signing Up</h2>

<p>The first thing your app will do is probably ask the user to sign up. The following code illustrates a typical sign up:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseUser</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">();</span>

<p>This call will asynchronously create a new user in your Parse App. Before it does this, it checks to make sure that both the username and email are unique. Also, it securely hashes the password in the cloud using bcrypt. We never store passwords in plaintext, nor will we ever transmit passwords back to the client in plaintext.</p>

<p>Note that we used the <code class="highlighter-rouge">signUpInBackground</code> method, not the <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveInBackground</code> method. New <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>s should always be created using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">signUpInBackground</code> (or <code class="highlighter-rouge">signUp</code>) method. Subsequent updates to a user can be done by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code>.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">signUpInBackground</code> method comes in various flavors, with the ability to pass back errors, and also synchronous versions. As usual, we highly recommend using the asynchronous versions when possible, so as not to block the UI in your app. You can read more about these specific methods in our <a href="/docs/android/">API docs</a>.</p>

<p>If a signup isn’t successful, you should read the error object that is returned. The most likely case is that the username or email has already been taken by another user. You should clearly communicate this to your users, and ask them try a different username.</p>

<p>You are free to use an email address as the username. Simply ask your users to enter their email, but fill it in the username property — <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> will work as normal. We’ll go over how this is handled in the reset password section.</p>

<h2 id="logging-in">Logging In</h2>

<p>Of course, after you allow users to sign up, you need be able to let them log in to their account in the future. To do this, you can use the class method <code class="highlighter-rouge">logInInBackground</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">logInInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Jerry"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"showmethemoney"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">LogInCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

      <span class="c1">// Signup failed. Look at the ParseException to see what happened.</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="verifying-emails">Verifying Emails</h2>

<p>Enabling email verification in an application’s settings allows the application to reserve part of its experience for users with confirmed email addresses. Email verification adds the <code class="highlighter-rouge">emailVerified</code> key to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> object. When a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">email</code> is set or modified, <code class="highlighter-rouge">emailVerified</code> is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>. Parse then emails the user a link which will set <code class="highlighter-rouge">emailVerified</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code>.</p>

<p>There are three <code class="highlighter-rouge">emailVerified</code> states to consider:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> - the user confirmed his or her email address by clicking on the link Parse emailed them. <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseUsers</code> can never have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> value when the user account is first created.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code> - at the time the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> object was last fetched, the user had not confirmed his or her email address. If <code class="highlighter-rouge">emailVerified</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>, consider calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">fetch()</code> on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>.</li>
  <li><em>missing</em> - the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> was created when email verification was off or the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> does not have an <code class="highlighter-rouge">email</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="current-user">Current User</h2>

<p>It would be bothersome if the user had to log in every time they open your app. You can avoid this by using the cached <code class="highlighter-rouge">currentUser</code> object.</p>

<p>Whenever you use any signup or login methods, the user is cached on disk. You can treat this cache as a session, and automatically assume the user is logged in:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseUser</span> <span class="n">currentUser</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentUser</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">currentUser</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

  <span class="c1">// show the signup or login screen</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can clear the current user by logging them out:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">logOut</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">ParseUser</span> <span class="n">currentUser</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentUser</span><span class="o">();</span> <span class="c1">// this will now be null</span>

</div>

<h2 id="anonymous-users">Anonymous Users</h2>

<p>Being able to associate data and objects with individual users is highly valuable, but sometimes you want to be able to do this without forcing a user to specify a username and password.</p>

<p>An anonymous user is a user that can be created without a username and password but still has all of the same capabilities as any other <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>. After logging out, an anonymous user is abandoned, and its data is no longer accessible.</p>

<p>You can create an anonymous user using <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseAnonymousUtils</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseAnonymousUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">logIn</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">LogInCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

      <span class="n">Log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">d</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"MyApp"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Anonymous login failed."</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="n">Log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">d</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"MyApp"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Anonymous user logged in."</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can convert an anonymous user into a regular user by setting the username and password, then calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">signUp()</code>, or by logging in or linking with a service like <a href="#fbusers">Facebook</a> or <a href="#twitterusers">Twitter</a>. The converted user will retain all of its data.  To determine whether the current user is an anonymous user, you can check <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseAnonymousUtils.isLinked()</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseAnonymousUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">isLinked</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentUser</span><span class="o">()))</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">enableSignUpButton</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">enableLogOutButton</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Anonymous users can also be automatically created for you without requiring a network request, so that you can begin working with your user immediately when your application starts.  When you enable automatic anonymous user creation at application startup, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseUser.getCurrentUser()</code> will never be <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>. The user will automatically be created in the cloud the first time the user or any object with a relation to the user is saved.  Until that point, the user’s object ID will be <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>.  Enabling automatic user creation makes associating data with your users painless.  For example, in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Application.onCreate()</code> method, you might write:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">enableAutomaticUser</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentUser</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">increment</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"RunCount"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentUser</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="setting-the-current-user">Setting the Current User</h2>

<p>If you’ve created your own authentication routines, or otherwise logged in a user on the server side, you can now pass the session token to the client and use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">become</code> method. This method will ensure the session token is valid before setting the current user.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">becomeInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"session-token-here"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">LogInCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<span class="o">});</span>

<h2 id="security-for-user-objects">Security For User Objects</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> class is secured by default. Data stored in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> can only be modified by that user. By default, the data can still be read by any client. Thus, some <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> objects are authenticated and can be modified, whereas others are read-only.</p>

<p>Specifically, you are not able to invoke any of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">delete</code> type methods unless the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> was obtained using an authenticated method, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">logIn</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">signUp</code>. This ensures that only the user can alter their own data.</p>

<p>The following illustrates this security policy:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseUser</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">logIn</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"my_username"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"my_password"</span><span class="o">);</span>

  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseUser</span> <span class="n">object</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setUsername</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"another_username"</span><span class="o">);</span>

    <span class="c1">// This will throw an exception, since the ParseUser is not authenticated</span>
    <span class="n">object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> obtained from <code class="highlighter-rouge">getCurrentUser()</code> will always be authenticated.</p>

<p>If you need to check if a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> is authenticated, you can invoke the <code class="highlighter-rouge">isAuthenticated()</code> method. You do not need to check <code class="highlighter-rouge">isAuthenticated()</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> objects that are obtained via an authenticated method.</p>

<h2 id="security-for-other-objects">Security for Other Objects</h2>

<p>The same security model that applies to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> can be applied to other objects. For any object, you can specify which users are allowed to read the object, and which users are allowed to modify an object. To support this type of security, each object has an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list">access control list</a>, implemented by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseACL</code> class.</p>

<p>The simplest way to use a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseACL</code> is to specify that an object may only be read or written by a single user. To create such an object, there must first be a logged in <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>. Then, <code class="highlighter-rouge">new ParseACL(user)</code> generates a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseACL</code> that limits access to that user. An object’s ACL is updated when the object is saved, like any other property. Thus, to create a private note that can only be accessed by the current user:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">privateNote</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Note"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">privateNote</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"content"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"This note is private!"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">privateNote</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentUser</span><span class="o">()));</span>
<span class="n">privateNote</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This note will then only be accessible to the current user, although it will be accessible to any device where that user is signed in. This functionality is useful for applications where you want to enable access to user data across multiple devices, like a personal todo list.</p>

<p>Permissions can also be granted on a per-user basis. You can add permissions individually to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseACL</code> using <code class="highlighter-rouge">setReadAccess</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">setWriteAccess</code>. For example, let’s say you have a message that will be sent to a group of several users, where each of them have the rights to read and delete that message:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">groupMessage</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Message"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">ParseACL</span> <span class="n">groupACL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">();</span>

<span class="c1">// userList is an Iterable&lt;ParseUser&gt; with the users we are sending this message to.</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseUser</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">userList</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">groupACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setReadAccess</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="n">groupACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setWriteAccess</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>

<span class="n">groupMessage</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">groupACL</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">groupMessage</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also grant permissions to all users at once using <code class="highlighter-rouge">setPublicReadAccess</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">setPublicWriteAccess</code>. This allows patterns like posting comments on a message board. For example, to create a post that can only be edited by its author, but can be read by anyone:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">publicPost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Post"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">ParseACL</span> <span class="n">postACL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentUser</span><span class="o">());</span>
<span class="n">postACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setPublicReadAccess</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">publicPost</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">postACL</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">publicPost</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To help ensure that your users’ data is secure by default, you can set a default ACL to be applied to all newly-created <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseObjects</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setDefaultACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">defaultACL</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In the code above, the second parameter to setDefaultACL tells Parse to ensure that the default ACL assigned at the time of object creation allows read and write access to the current user at that time.  Without this setting, you would need to reset the defaultACL every time a user logs in or out so that the current user would be granted access appropriately.  With this setting, you can ignore changes to the current user until you explicitly need to grant different kinds of access.</p>

<p>Default ACLs make it easy to create apps that follow common access patterns. An application like Twitter, for example, where user content is generally visible to the world, might set a default ACL such as:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseACL</span> <span class="n">defaultACL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">defaultACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setPublicReadAccess</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setDefaultACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">defaultACL</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>For an application like Dropbox, where a user’s data is only accessible by the user itself unless explicit permission is given, you would provide a default ACL where only the current user is given access:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setDefaultACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">(),</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>An application that logs data to Parse but doesn’t provide any user access to that data would instead deny access to the current user while providing a restrictive ACL:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setDefaultACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">(),</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Operations that are forbidden, such as deleting an object that you do not have write access to, result in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseException.OBJECT_NOT_FOUND</code> error code. For security purposes, this prevents clients from distinguishing which object ids exist but are secured, versus which object ids do not exist at all.</p>

<h2 id="resetting-passwords">Resetting Passwords</h2>

<p>It’s a fact that as soon as you introduce passwords into a system, users will forget them. In such cases, our library provides a way to let them securely reset their password.</p>

<p>To kick off the password reset flow, ask the user for their email address, and call:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">requestPasswordResetInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"myemail@example.com"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">RequestPasswordResetCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// An email was successfully sent with reset instructions.</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// Something went wrong. Look at the ParseException to see what's up.</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This will attempt to match the given email with the user’s email or username field, and will send them a password reset email. By doing this, you can opt to have users use their email as their username, or you can collect it separately and store it in the email field.</p>

<p>The flow for password reset is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>User requests that their password be reset by typing in their email.</li>
  <li>Parse sends an email to their address, with a special password reset link.</li>
  <li>User clicks on the reset link, and is directed to a special Parse page that will allow them type in a new password.</li>
  <li>User types in a new password. Their password has now been reset to a value they specify.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the messaging in this flow will reference your app by the name that you specified when you created this app on Parse.</p>

<h2 id="querying">Querying</h2>

<p>To query for users, you need to use the special user query:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">();</span>

    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In addition, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">get</code> to get a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> by id.</p>

<h2 id="associations">Associations</h2>

<p>Associations involving a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> work right of the box. For example, let’s say you’re making a blogging app. To store a new post for a user and retrieve all their posts:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseUser</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentUser</span><span class="o">();</span>

<h2 id="facebook-users">Facebook Users</h2>

<p>Parse provides an easy way to integrate Facebook with your application. The Facebook SDK can be used with our SDK, and is integrated with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> class to make linking your users to their Facebook identities easy.</p>

<p>Using our Facebook integration, you can associate an authenticated Facebook user with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>. With just a few lines of code, you’ll be able to provide a “Log in with Facebook” option in your app, and be able to save their data to Parse.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Parse is compatible with both Facebook SDK 3.x and 4.x for Android. These instructions are for Facebook SDK 4.x.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>To start using Facebook with Parse, you need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps">Set up a Facebook app</a>, if you haven’t already.</li>
  <li>Add your application’s Facebook Application ID on your Parse application’s settings page.</li>
  <li>Follow Facebook’s instructions for <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started">getting started with the Facebook SDK</a> to create an app linked to the Facebook SDK.  Once you get to Step 6, stop after linking the Facebook SDK project and configuring the Facebook app ID. You can use our guide to attach your Parse users to Facebook accounts when logging in.</li>
  <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.parse:parsefacebookutils-v4-android:1.10.3@aar</code> to your Gradle dependencies. This includes the contents of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse-*.jar</code> and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.parse:parse-android:1.10.+</code> repository, so be sure to remove as needed to prevent duplicate dependencies, otherwise a <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.android.dex.DexException</code> will be thrown.</li>
  <li>Add the following where you initialize the Parse SDK in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Application.onCreate()</code>:</li>
</ol>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">java
  ParseFacebookUtils.initialize(context);
 </code></p>

<p>Facebook’s Android SDK provides an enhanced login experience on devices that have <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.facebook.katana">Facebook’s official Android app</a> installed. This allows users of apps that support Facebook login to sign in directly through the Facebook app, using credentials that are already on the device. If the Facebook app is not installed, the default dialog-based authentication will be used. Facebook calls this feature “Single sign-on” (SSO), and requires you to override <code class="highlighter-rouge">onActivityResult()</code> in your calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">@Override</span>
<span class="kd">protected</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onActivityResult</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">requestCode</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">resultCode</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Intent</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">super</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">onActivityResult</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">requestCode</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">resultCode</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="n">ParseFacebookUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">onActivityResult</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">requestCode</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">resultCode</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code> is already using <code class="highlighter-rouge">onActivityResult()</code>, you can avoid <code class="highlighter-rouge">requestCode</code> collisions by specifying your own request code offset when initializing <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseFacebookUtils.initialize(context, callbackRequestCodeOffset)</code>. Otherwise, a sensible default <code class="highlighter-rouge">activityCode</code> will be used.</p>

<p>If you encounter any issues that are Facebook-related, a good resource is the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/android/">official Facebook SDK for Android page</a>.</p>

<p>There are two main ways to use Facebook with your Parse users: (1) logging in as a Facebook user and creating a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>, or (2) linking Facebook to an existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>.</p>

<div class="tip info"><div>
  It is up to you to record any data that you need from the Facebook user after they authenticate. To accomplish this, you'll need to [do a graph query via Facebook's SDK](https://parse.com/questions/how-can-i-find-parse-users-that-are-facebook-friends-with-the-current-user).
</div></div>

<h3 id="login-amp-signup">Login &amp; Signup</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseFacebookUtils</code> provides a way to allow your <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>s to log in or sign up through Facebook. This is generally accomplished using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">logInWithReadPermissionsInBackground(String, Collection&lt;String&gt;)</code> method:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseFacebookUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">logInWithReadPermissionsInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">permissions</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">LogInCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">isNew</span><span class="o">())</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="n">Log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">d</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"MyApp"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"User signed up and logged in through Facebook!"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="n">Log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">d</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"MyApp"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"User logged in through Facebook!"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When this code is run, the following happens:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user is shown the Facebook login dialog or a prompt generated by the Facebook app.</li>
  <li>The user authenticates via Facebook, and your app receives a callback.</li>
  <li>Our SDK receives the user’s Facebook access data and saves it to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>. If no <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> exists with the same Facebook ID, then a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> is created.</li>
  <li>Your <code class="highlighter-rouge">LogInCallback</code> is called with the user.</li>
  <li>The current user reference will be updated to this user.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to display the Facebook login dialogs and activities, the current <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code> must be provided (often, the current activity is <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> when calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">logInWithReadPermissionsInBackground()</code> from within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code>) as we have done above.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> integration doesn’t require any permissions to work out of the box (i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code> is perfectly acceptable). When logging in, you can only use read permissions. See our documentation below about <a href="#fbusers-permissions">requesting additional permissions</a> (read or publish). <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/permissions/">Read more about permissions on Facebook’s developer guide.</a></p>

<h3 id="facebook-linking">Facebook Linking</h3>

<p>If you want to associate an existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> to a Facebook account, you can link it like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(!</span><span class="n">ParseFacebookUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">isLinked</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">))</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="nd">@Override</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">ex</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseFacebookUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">isLinked</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">))</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">Log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">d</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"MyApp"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Woohoo, user logged in with Facebook!"</span><span class="o">);</span>
      <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">});</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The steps that happen when linking are very similar to log in. The difference is that on successful login, the existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> is updated with the Facebook information. Future logins via Facebook will now log the user into their existing account.</p>

<p>If you want to unlink Facebook from a user, simply do this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseFacebookUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">unlinkInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">SaveCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ex</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="n">Log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">d</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"MyApp"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"The user is no longer associated with their Facebook account."</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="requesting-permissions">Requesting Permissions</h3>

<p>As of v3.0 of the Facebook SDK, read and publish permissions must be requested separately. To request additional permissions, you may call <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseFacebookUtils.linkWithReadPermissionsInBackground()</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseFacebookUtils.linkWithPublishPermissionsInBackground()</code>. For more information about requesting new permissions, please see <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/android/permissions">Facebook’s API documentation for these functions</a>.</p>

<p>After successfully retrieving new permissions, please call <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseFacebookUtilities.linkInBackground(ParseUser, AccessToken)</code>, which will save any changes to the session token back to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> and ensure that this session data follows the user wherever it logs in.</p>

<h3 id="facebook-sdk-and-parse">Facebook SDK and Parse</h3>

<p>The Facebook Android SDK provides a number of helper classes for interacting with Facebook’s API. Generally, you will use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">GraphRequest</code> class to interact with Facebook on behalf of your logged-in user. <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/android/current">You can read more about the Facebook SDK here</a>.</p>

<p>To access the user’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">AccessToken</code> you can simply call <code class="highlighter-rouge">AccessToken.getCurrentAccessToken()</code> to access the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AccessToken</code> instance, which can then be passed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">GraphRequest</code>s.</p>

<h2 id="twitter-users">Twitter Users</h2>

<p>As with Facebook, Parse also provides an easy way to integrate Twitter authentication into your application. The Parse SDK provides a straightforward way to authorize and link a Twitter account to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>s. With just a few lines of code, you’ll be able to provide a “log in with Twitter” option in your app, and be able to save their data to Parse.</p>

<h3 id="setup-1">Setup</h3>

<p>To start using Twitter with Parse, you need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/apps">Set up a Twitter app</a>, if you haven’t already.</li>
  <li>Add your application’s Twitter consumer key on your Parse application’s settings page.</li>
  <li>When asked to specify a “Callback URL” for your Twitter app, please insert a valid URL. This value will not be used by your iOS or Android application, but is necessary in order to enable authentication through Twitter.</li>
  <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">compile 'com.parse:parsetwitterutils-android:1.10.+'</code> to your Gradle dependencies. This includes the contents of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse-*.jar</code> and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.parse:parse-android:1.10.+</code> repository, so be sure to remove as needed to prevent duplicate dependencies, otherwise a <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.android.dex.DexException</code> will be thrown.</li>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(!</span><span class="n">ParseTwitterUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">isLinked</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">))</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="nd">@Override</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">ex</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseTwitterUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">isLinked</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">))</span> <span class="o">{</span>

      <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">});</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The steps that happen when linking are very similar to log in. The difference is that on successful login, the existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> is updated with the Twitter information. Future logins via Twitter will now log the user into their existing account.</p>

<p>If you want to unlink Twitter from a user, simply do this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseTwitterUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">unlinkInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">SaveCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<h3 id="twitter-api-calls">Twitter API Calls</h3>

<p>Our SDK provides a straightforward way to sign your API HTTP requests to the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api">Twitter REST API</a> when your app has a Twitter-linked <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>.  To make a request through our API, you can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Twitter</code> singleton provided by <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseTwitterUtils</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">HttpClient</span> <span class="n">client</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">DefaultHttpClient</span><span class="o">();</span>

<h1 id="sessions">Sessions</h1>

<p>Sessions represent an instance of a user logged into a device. Sessions are automatically created when users log in or sign up. They are automatically deleted when users log out. There is one distinct <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> object for each user-installation pair; if a user issues a login request from a device they’re already logged into, that user’s previous <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> object for that Installation is automatically deleted. <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> objects are stored on Parse in the Session class, and you can view them on the Parse.com Data Browser. We provide a set of APIs to manage <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> objects in your app.</p>

<div class="tip info"><div>
  Session APIs are only available in apps with revocable sessions enabled. Parse apps created after March 25, 2015 have this enabled by default ("Require Revocable Sessions" toggle in your Parse.com app settings page). If you have an existing app, you can upgrade to revocable sessions by following the [Session Migration Tutorial](https://www.parse.com/tutorials/session-migration-tutorial).
</div></div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> is a subclass of <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, so you can query, update, and delete sessions in the same way that you manipulate normal objects on Parse. Because the Parse Cloud automatically creates sessions when you log in or sign up users, you should not manually create <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> objects unless you are building a “Parse for IoT” app (e.g. Arduino or Embedded C). Deleting a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> will log the user out of the device that is currently using this session’s token.</p>

<p>Unlike other Parse objects, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> class does not have Cloud Code triggers. So you cannot register a <code class="highlighter-rouge">beforeSave</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">afterSave</code> handler for the Session class.</p>

<h2 id="properties-1">Properties</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> object has these special fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">sessionToken</code> (readonly): String token for authentication on Parse API requests. In the response of <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> queries, only your current <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> object will contain a session token.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">user</code>: (readonly) Pointer to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> object that this session is for.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">createdWith</code> (readonly): Information about how this session was created (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"login"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">"authProvider"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"password"</span><span class="p">}</span></code>).
    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">action</code> could have values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">login</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">signup</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">create</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">upgrade</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">create</code> action is when the developer manually creates the session by saving a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> object.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">upgrade</code> action is when the user is upgraded to revocable session from a legacy session token.</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">authProvider</code> could have values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">password</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">anonymous</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">facebook</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">twitter</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">restricted</code> (readonly): Boolean for whether this session is restricted.
    <ul>
      <li>Restricted sessions do not have write permissions on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code> classes on Parse. Restricted sessions also cannot read unrestricted sessions.</li>
      <li>All sessions that the Parse Cloud automatically creates during user login/signup will be unrestricted. All sessions that the developer manually creates by saving a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> object from the client (only needed for “Parse for IoT” apps) will be restricted.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">expiresAt</code> (readonly): Approximate UTC date when this <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> object will be automatically deleted. You can configure session expiration settings (either 1-year inactivity expiration or no expiration) in your app’s Parse.com dashboard settings page.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">installationId</code> (can be set only once): String referring to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> where the session is logged in from. For Parse SDKs, this field will be automatically set when users log in or sign up.
All special fields except <code class="highlighter-rouge">installationId</code> can only be set automatically by the Parse Cloud. You can add custom fields onto <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> objects, but please keep in mind that any logged-in device (with session token) can read other sessions that belong to the same user (unless you disable Class-Level Permissions, see below).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="handling-invalid-session-token-error">Handling Invalid Session Token Error</h2>

<p>Apps created before March 25, 2015 use legacy session tokens until you migrate them to use the new revocable sessions. On API requests with legacy tokens, if the token is invalid (e.g. User object was deleted), then the request is executed as a non-logged in user and no error was returned. On API requests with revocable session tokens, an invalid session token will always fail with the “invalid session token” error. This new behavior lets you know when you need to ask the user to log in again.</p>

<p>With revocable sessions, your current session token could become invalid if its corresponding <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> object is deleted from the Parse Cloud. This could happen if you implement a Session Manager UI that lets users log out of other devices, or if you manually delete the session via Cloud Code, REST API, or Data Browser. Sessions could also be deleted due to automatic expiration (if configured in app settings). When a device’s session token no longer corresponds to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> object on the Parse Cloud, all API requests from that device will fail with “Error 209: invalid session token”.</p>

<p>To handle this error, we recommend writing a global utility function that is called by all of your Parse request error callbacks. You can then handle the “invalid session token” error in this global function. You should prompt the user to login again so that they can obtain a new session token. This code could look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-objc">@interface ParseErrorHandlingController : NSObject

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> objects can only be accessed by the user specified in the user field. All <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> objects have an ACL that is read and write by that user only. You cannot change this ACL. This means querying for sessions will only return objects that match the current logged-in user.</p>

<p>When you log in a user via <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser.logInInBackground()}</code>, Parse will automatically create a new unrestricted <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> object in the Parse Cloud. Same for signups and Facebook/Twitter logins.</p>

<p>Session objects manually created from client SDKs (by creating an instance of <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code>, and saving it) are always restricted. You cannot manually create an unrestricted sessions using the object creation API.</p>

<p>Restricted sessions are prohibited from creating, modifying, or deleting any data in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code> classes. Restricted session also cannot read unrestricted sessions. Restricted Sessions are useful for “Parse for IoT” devices (e.g Arduino or Embedded C) that may run in a less-trusted physical environment than mobile apps. However, please keep in mind that restricted sessions can still read data on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code> classes, and can read/write data in any other class just like a normal session. So it is still important for IoT devices to be in a safe physical environment and ideally use encrypted storage to store the session token.</p>

<p>If you want to prevent restricted Sessions from modifying classes other than <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code>, you can write a Cloud Code <code class="highlighter-rouge">beforeSave</code> handler for that class:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">Parse</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Cloud</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">beforeSave</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"MyClass"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You can configure Class-Level Permissions (CLPs) for the Session class just like other classes on Parse. CLPs restrict reading/writing of sessions via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseSession}</code> API, but do not restrict Parse Cloud’s automatic session creation/deletion when users log in, sign up, and log out. We recommend that you disable all CLPs not needed by your app. Here are some common use cases for Session CLPs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Find</strong>, <strong>Delete</strong> — Useful for building a UI screen that allows users to see their active session on all devices, and log out of sessions on other devices. If your app does not have this feature, you should disable these permissions.</li>
  <li><strong>Create</strong> — Useful for “Parse for IoT” apps (e.g. Arduino or Embedded C) that provision restricted user sessions for other devices from the phone app. You should disable this permission when building apps for mobile and web. For “Parse for IoT” apps, you should check whether your IoT device actually needs to access user-specific data. If not, then your IoT device does not need a user session, and you should disable this permission.</li>
  <li><strong>Get</strong>, <strong>Update</strong>, <strong>Add Field</strong> — Unless you need these operations, you should disable these permissions.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="roles">Roles</h1>

<p>As your app grows in scope and user-base, you may find yourself needing more coarse-grained control over access to pieces of your data than user-linked ACLs can provide. To address this requirement, Parse supports a form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role-based Access Control</a>. Roles provide a logical way of grouping users with common access privileges to your Parse data. Roles are named objects that contain users and other roles.  Any permission granted to a role is implicitly granted to its users as well as to the users of any roles that it contains.</p>

<p>For example, in your application with curated content, you may have a number of users that are considered “Moderators” and can modify and delete content created by other users.  You may also have a set of users that are “Administrators” and are allowed all of the same privileges as Moderators, but can also modify the global settings for the application. By adding users to these roles, you can ensure that new users can be made moderators or administrators, without having to manually grant permission to every resource for each user.</p>

<p>We provide a specialized class called <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code> that represents these role objects in your client code. <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code> is a subclass of <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, and has all of the same features, such as a flexible schema, automatic persistence, and a key value interface.  All the methods that are on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> also exist on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code>.  The difference is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code> has some additions specific to management of roles.</p>

<h2 id="properties-2">Properties</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code> has several properties that set it apart from <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>name</strong>: The name for the role. This value is required, and can only be set once as a role is being created. The name must consist of alphanumeric characters, spaces, -, or _.  This name will be used to identify the Role without needing its objectId.</li>
  <li><strong>users</strong>: A <a href="#objects-pointers">relation</a> to the set of users that will inherit permissions granted to the containing role.</li>
  <li><strong>roles</strong>: A <a href="#objects-pointers">relation</a> to the set of roles whose users and roles will inherit permissions granted to the containing role.</li>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code> uses the same security scheme (ACLs) as all other objects on Parse, except that it requires an ACL to be set explicitly. Generally, only users with greatly elevated privileges (e.g. a master user or Administrator) should be able to create or modify a Role, so you should define its ACLs accordingly.  Remember, if you give write-access to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code> to a user, that user can add other users to the role, or even delete the role altogether.</p>

<p>To create a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code>, you would write:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// By specifying no write privileges for the ACL, we can ensure the role cannot be altered.</span>
<span class="n">ParseACL</span> <span class="n">roleACL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">roleACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setPublicReadAccess</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">ParseRole</span> <span class="n">role</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseRole</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Administrator"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">roleACL</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">role</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can add users and roles that should inherit your new role’s permissions through the “users” and “roles” relations on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseRole</span> <span class="n">role</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseRole</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">roleName</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">roleACL</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="o">}</span>
<span class="n">role</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Take great care when assigning ACLs to your roles so that they can only be modified by those who should have permissions to modify them.</p>

<h2 id="security-for-other-objects-1">Security for Other Objects</h2>

<p>Now that you have created a set of roles for use in your application, you can use them with ACLs to define the privileges that their users will receive. Each <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> can specify a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseACL</code>, which provides an access control list that indicates which users and roles should be granted read or write access to the object.</p>

<p>Giving a role read or write permission to an object is straightforward.  You can either use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseRole}</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseRole</span> <span class="n">moderators</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="cm">/* Query for some ParseRole */</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">wallPost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"WallPost"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">ParseACL</span> <span class="n">postACL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">postACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setRoleWriteAccess</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">moderators</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">wallPost</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">postACL</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">wallPost</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can avoid querying for a role by specifying its name for the ACL:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">wallPost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"WallPost"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">ParseACL</span> <span class="n">postACL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">postACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setRoleWriteAccess</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Moderators"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">wallPost</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">postACL</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">wallPost</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">save</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Role-based <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseACL</code>s can also be used when specifying default ACLs for your application, making it easy to protect your users’ data while granting access to users with additional privileges.  For example, a moderated forum application might specify a default ACL like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseACL</span> <span class="n">defaultACL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="c1">// Everybody can read objects created by this user</span>
<span class="n">defaultACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setPublicReadAccess</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="c1">// Moderators can also modify these objects</span>
<span class="n">defaultACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setRoleWriteAccess</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Moderators"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="c1">// And the user can read and modify its own objects</span>
<span class="n">ParseACL</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setDefaultACL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">defaultACL</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="role-hierarchy">Role Hierarchy</h2>

<p>As described above, one role can contain another, establishing a parent-child relationship between the two roles. The consequence of this relationship is that any permission granted to the parent role is implicitly granted to all of its child roles.</p>

<p>These types of relationships are commonly found in applications with user-managed content, such as forums. Some small subset of users are “Administrators”, with the highest level of access to tweaking the application’s settings, creating new forums, setting global messages, and so on. Another set of users are “Moderators”, who are responsible for ensuring that the content created by users remains appropriate. Any user with Administrator privileges should also be granted the permissions of any Moderator. To establish this relationship, you would make your “Administrators” role a child role of “Moderators”, like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseRole</span> <span class="n">administrators</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="cm">/* Your "Administrators" role */</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="n">ParseRole</span> <span class="n">moderators</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="cm">/* Your "Moderators" role */</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="n">moderators</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getRoles</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">administrators</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">moderators</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="files">Files</h1>

<h2 id="the-parsefile">The ParseFile</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseFile}</code> lets you store application files in the cloud that would otherwise be too large or cumbersome to fit into a regular <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>. The most common use case is storing images but you can also use it for documents, videos, music, and any other binary data (up to 10 megabytes).</p>

<p>Getting started with <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseFile}</code> is easy. First, you’ll need to have the data in <code class="highlighter-rouge">byte[]</code> form and then create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseFile}</code> with it. In this example, we’ll just use a string:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">byte</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"Working at Parse is great!"</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getBytes</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">ParseFile</span> <span class="n">file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseFile</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"resume.txt"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Notice in this example that we give the file a name of <code class="highlighter-rouge">resume.txt</code>. There’s two things to note here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You don’t need to worry about filename collisions. Each upload gets a unique identifier so there’s no problem with uploading multiple files named <code class="highlighter-rouge">resume.txt</code>.</li>
  <li>It’s important that you give a name to the file that has a file extension. This lets Parse figure out the file type and handle it accordingly. So, if you’re storing PNG images, make sure your filename ends with <code class="highlighter-rouge">.png</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next you’ll want to save the file up to the cloud. As with <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, there are many variants of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code> method you can use depending on what sort of callback and error handling suits you.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Finally, after the save completes, you can associate a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseFile}</code> onto a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> just like any other piece of data:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span> <span class="n">jobApplication</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"JobApplication"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">jobApplication</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"applicantName"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Joe Smith"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">jobApplication</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"applicantResumeFile"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">jobApplication</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Retrieving it back involves calling one of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">getData</code> variants on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>. Here we retrieve the resume file off another JobApplication object:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseFile</span> <span class="n">applicantResume</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseFile</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="n">anotherApplication</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"applicantResumeFile"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">applicantResume</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getDataInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">GetDataCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">byte</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// data has the bytes for the resume</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// something went wrong</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Just like on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, you will most likely want to use the background version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">getData</code>.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p>It’s easy to get the progress of both uploads and downloads using ParseFile by passing a ProgressCallback to <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveInBackground</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">getDataInBackground</code>. For example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">byte</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"Working at Parse is great!"</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getBytes</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">ParseFile</span> <span class="n">file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseFile</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"resume.txt"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="n">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">SaveCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Handle success or failure here ...</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">},</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ProgressCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Integer</span> <span class="n">percentDone</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Update your progress spinner here. percentDone will be between 0 and 100.</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can delete files that are referenced by objects using the <a href="/docs/rest/guide/#files-deleting-files">REST API</a>. You will need to provide the master key in order to be allowed to delete a file.</p>

<p>If your files are not referenced by any object in your app, it is not possible to delete them through the REST API. You may request a cleanup of unused files in your app’s Settings page. Keep in mind that doing so may break functionality which depended on accessing unreferenced files through their URL property. Files that are currently associated with an object will not be affected.</p>

<h1 id="geopoints">GeoPoints</h1>

<p>Parse allows you to associate real-world latitude and longitude coordinates with an object.  Adding a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseGeoPoint</code> to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> allows queries to take into account the proximity of an object to a reference point.  This allows you to easily do things like find out what user is closest to another user or which places are closest to a user.</p>

<h2 id="parsegeopoint">ParseGeoPoint</h2>

<p>To associate a point with an object you first need to create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseGeoPoint</code>.  For example, to create a point with latitude of 40.0 degrees and -30.0 degrees longitude:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseGeoPoint</span> <span class="n">point</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseGeoPoint</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mf">40.0</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">30.0</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This point is then stored in the object as a regular field.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">placeObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"location"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">point</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="geo-queries">Geo Queries</h2>

<p>Now that you have a bunch of objects with spatial coordinates, it would be nice to find out which objects are closest to a point.  This can be done by adding another restriction to <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> using <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereNear</code>.  Getting a list of ten places that are closest to a user may look something like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseGeoPoint</span> <span class="n">userLocation</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseGeoPoint</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">userObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"location"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"PlaceObject"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">whereNear</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"location"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">userLocation</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setLimit</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">findInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">FindCallback</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>At this point <code class="highlighter-rouge">nearPlaces</code> will be an array of objects ordered by distance (nearest to farthest) from <code class="highlighter-rouge">userLocation</code>. Note that if an additional <code class="highlighter-rouge">orderByAscending()</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">orderByDescending()</code> constraint is applied, it will take precedence over the distance ordering.</p>

<p>To limit the results using distance, check out <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereWithinKilometers</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereWithinMiles</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereWithinRadians</code>.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to query for the set of objects that are contained within a particular area.  To find the objects in a rectangular bounding box, add the <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereWithinGeoBox</code> restriction to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseGeoPoint</span> <span class="n">southwestOfSF</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseGeoPoint</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mf">37.708813</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">122.526398</span><span class="o">);</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p>At the moment there are a couple of things to watch out for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each ParseObject class may only have one key with a ParseGeoPoint object.</li>
  <li>Using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">whereNear</code> constraint will also limit results to within 100 miles.</li>
  <li>Points should not equal or exceed the extreme ends of the ranges.  Latitude should not be -90.0 or 90.0.  Longitude should not be -180.0 or 180.0.  Attempting to set latitude or longitude out of bounds will cause an error.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="local-datastore">Local Datastore</h1>

<p>The Parse Android SDK provides a local datastore which can be used to store and retrieve <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>s, even when the network is unavailable. To enable this functionality, simply call <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.enableLocalDatastore()</code> before your call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">initialize</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">com.parse.Parse</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">android.app.Application</span><span class="o">;</span>

<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">App</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="n">Application</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">onCreate</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kd">super</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">onCreate</span><span class="o">();</span>

    <span class="n">Parse</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">enableLocalDatastore</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="n">Parse</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">initialize</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">PARSE_APPLICATION_ID</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">PARSE_CLIENT_KEY</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There are a couple of side effects of enabling the local datastore that you should be aware of. When enabled, there will only be one instance of any given <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>. For example, imagine you have an instance of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">"GameScore"</code> class with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectId</code> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">"xWMyZ4YEGZ"</code>, and then you issue a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> for all instances of <code class="highlighter-rouge">"GameScore"</code> with that <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectId</code>. The result will be the same instance of the object you already have in memory.</p>

<p>Another side effect is that the current user and current installation will be stored in the local datastore, so you can persist unsaved changes to these objects between runs of your app using the methods below.</p>

<p>Calling the <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveEventually</code> method on a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> will cause the object to be pinned in the local datastore until the save completes. So now, if you change the current <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> and call <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseUser.getCurrentUser().saveEventually()</code>, your app will always see the changes that you have made.</p>

<h2 id="pinning">Pinning</h2>

<p>You can store a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> in the local datastore by pinning it. Pinning a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> is recursive, just like saving, so any objects that are pointed to by the one you are pinning will also be pinned. When an object is pinned, every time you update it by fetching or saving new data, the copy in the local datastore will be updated
      automatically. You don’t need to worry about it at all.</p>

<p>If you have multiple objects, you can pin them all at once with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pinAllInBackground</code> convenience method.</p>

<h2 id="retrieving-objects-1">Retrieving Objects</h2>

<p>Storing objects is great, but it’s only useful if you can then get the objects back out later. Retrieving an object from the local datastore works just like retrieving one over the network. The only difference is calling the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fromLocalDatastore</code> method to tell the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> where to look for its results.</p>

<h2 id="querying-1">Querying</h2>

<p>Often, you’ll want to find a whole list of objects that match certain criteria, instead of getting a single object by id. To do that, you can use a <a href="#queries">ParseQuery</a>. Any <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> can be used with the local datastore just as with the network. The results will include any object you have pinned that matches the query. Any unsaved changes you have made to the object will be considered when evaluating the query. So you can find a local object that matches, even if it was never returned from the server for this particular query.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"GameScore"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<h2 id="unpinning">Unpinning</h2>

<p>When you are done with an object and no longer need it to be in the local datastore, you can simply unpin it. This will free up disk space on the device and keep your queries on the local datastore running quickly.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">unpinInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There’s also a method to unpin several objects at once.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">unpinAllInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">listOfObjects</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="pinning-with-labels">Pinning with Labels</h2>

<p>Manually pinning and unpinning each object individual is a bit like using <code class="highlighter-rouge">malloc</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">free</code>. It is a very powerful tool, but it can be difficult to manage what objects get stored in complex scenarios. For example, imagine you are making a game with separate high score lists for global high scores and your friends’ high scores. If one of your friends happens to have a globally high score, you need to make sure you don’t unpin them completely when you remove them from one of the cached queries. To make these scenarios easier, you can also pin with a label. Labels indicate a group of objects that should be stored together.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Add several objects with a label.</span>
<span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">pinAllInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"MyScores"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">someGameScores</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="c1">// Add another object with the same label.</span>
<span class="n">anotherGameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">pinInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"MyScores"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To unpin all of the objects with the same label at the same time, you can pass a label to the unpin methods. This saves you from having to manually track which objects are in each group you care about.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">unpinAllInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"MyScores"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Any object will stay in the datastore as long as it is pinned with any label. In other words, if you pin an object with two different labels, and then unpin it with one label, the object will stay in the datastore until you also unpin it with the other label.</p>

<h2 id="caching-query-results">Caching Query Results</h2>

<p>Pinning with labels makes it easy to cache the results of queries. You can use one label to pin the results of each different query. To get new results from the network, just do a query and update the pinned objects.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="err">“</span><span class="n">GameScore</span><span class="err">"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<h2 id="syncing-local-changes">Syncing Local Changes</h2>

<p>Once you’ve saved some changes locally, there are a few different ways you can save those changes back to Parse over the network. The easiest way to do this is with <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveEventually</code>. When you call <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveEventually</code> on a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, it will be pinned until it can be saved. The SDK will make sure to save the object the next time the network is available.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">gameScore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveEventually</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you’d like to have more control over the way objects are synced, you can keep them in the local datastore until you are ready to save them yourself using <code class="highlighter-rouge">saveInBackground</code>. To manage the set of objects that need to be saved, you can again use a label. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">fromPin</code> method on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> makes it easy to fetch just the objects you care about.</p>

<h1 id="push-notifications">Push Notifications</h1>

<p>Push notifications are a great way to keep your users engaged and informed about your app. You can reach your entire user base quickly and effectively. This guide will help you through the setup process and the general usage of Parse to send push notifications.</p>

<p>If you haven’t installed the SDK yet, <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki/Push#quick-start">head over to the Push QuickStart</a> to get our SDK up and running.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-push">Setting Up Push</h2>

<p>If you want to start using push, start by completing the <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki/Push#quick-start">Android Push Notifications QuickStart Guide</a> to learn how to configure your app and send your first push notification. Come back to this guide afterwards to learn more about the push features offered by Parse.</p>

<p>The Parse library provides push notifications using Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) if Google Play Services are available. Learn more about Google Play Services <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview">here</a>.</p>

<p>When sending pushes to Android devices with GCM, there are several pieces of information that Parse keeps track of automatically:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Registration ID</strong>: The GCM registration ID uniquely identifies an app/device pairing for push purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Sender ID</strong>: The GCM sender ID is a public number that identifies the sender of a push notification.</li>
  <li><strong>API key</strong>: The GCM API key is a server secret that allows a server to send pushes to a registration ID on behalf of a particular sender ID.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Parse Android SDK chooses a reasonable default configuration so that you do not have to worry about GCM registration ids, sender ids, or API keys. In particular, the SDK will automatically register your app for push at startup time using Parse’s sender ID (1076345567071) and will store the resulting registration ID in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">deviceToken</code> field of the app’s current <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code>.</p>

<p>However, as an advanced feature for developers that want to send pushes from multiple push providers, Parse allows you to optionally register your app for pushes with additional GCM sender IDs. To do this, specify the additional GCM sender ID with the following <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;meta-data&gt;</code> tag as a child of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;application&gt;</code> element in your app’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">meta</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="nl">android:</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"com.parse.push.gcm_sender_id"</span>
           <span class="nl">android:</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"id:YOUR_SENDER_ID"</span> <span class="o">/&gt;;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In the sample snippet above, <code class="highlighter-rouge">YOUR_SENDER_ID</code> should be replaced by a numeric GCM sender ID. Note that the Parse SDK expects you to prefix your sender ID with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">id:</code> prefix, as shown in the sample snippet.</p>

<p>If you want to register your app with multiple additional sender IDs, then the <code class="highlighter-rouge">android:value</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;meta-data&gt;</code> element above should hold a comma-delimited list of sender IDs, as in the following snippet:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">meta</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="nl">android:</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"com.parse.push.gcm_sender_id"</span>
           <span class="nl">android:</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"id:YOUR_SENDER_ID_1,YOUR_SENDER_ID_2,YOUR_SENDER_ID_3"</span> <span class="o">/&gt;;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="installations">Installations</h2>

<p>Every Parse application installed on a device registered for push notifications has an associated <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> object. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> object is where you store all the data needed to target push notifications. For example, in a baseball app, you could store the teams a user is interested in to send updates about their performance. Saving the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> object is also required for tracking push-related app open events.</p>

<p>In Android, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> objects are available through the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> class, a subclass of <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>. It uses the <a href="#objects">same API</a> for storing and retrieving data. To access the current <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> object from your Android app, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseInstallation.getCurrentInstallation()</code> method. The first time you save a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code>, Parse will add it to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> class and it will be available for targeting push notifications.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Save the current Installation to Parse.</span>
<span class="n">ParseInstallation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentInstallation</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>While it is possible to modify a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> just like you would a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, there are several special fields that help manage and target devices.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">channels</code></strong>: An array of the channels to which a device is currently subscribed.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">installationId</code></strong>: Unique Id for the device used by Parse <em>(readonly)</em>.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">deviceType</code></strong>: The type of device, “ios”, “osx”, “android”, “winrt”, “winphone”, “dotnet”, or “embedded”. On Android devices, this field will be set to “android” <em>(readonly)</em>.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">pushType</code></strong>: This field is reserved for directing Parse to the push delivery network to be used. If the device is registered to receive pushes via GCM, this field will be marked “gcm”. If Google Play Services is not available, it will be blank <em>(readonly)</em>.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">GCMSenderId</code></strong>: This field only has meaning for Android <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code>s that use the GCM push type. It is reserved for directing Parse to send pushes to this installation with an alternate GCM sender ID. This field should generally not be set unless you are uploading installation data from another push provider. If you set this field, then you must set the GCM API key corresponding to this GCM sender ID in your Parse application’s push settings.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">deviceToken</code></strong>: The token used by GCM to keep track of registration ID. On iOS devices, this is the Apple generated token <em>(readonly)</em>.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">appName</code></strong>: The display name of the client application to which this installation belongs. This value is synchronized every time an <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> object is saved from the device  <em>(readonly)</em>.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">appVersion</code></strong>: The version string of the client application to which this installation belongs.

</ul>

<p>The Parse Android SDK will avoid making unnecessary requests. If a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> is saved on the device, a request to the Parse servers will only be made if one of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code>’s fields has been explicitly updated.</p>

<h2 id="sending-pushes">Sending Pushes</h2>

<p>There are two ways to send push notifications using Parse: <a href="#push-notifications-using-channels">channels</a> and <a href="#push-notifications-using-advanced-targeting">advanced targeting</a>. Channels offer a simple and easy to use model for sending pushes, while advanced targeting offers a more powerful and flexible model. Both are fully compatible with each other and will be covered in this section.</p>

<p>Sending notifications is often done from the Parse.com push console, the <a href="/docs/rest/guide#push-notifications-sending-pushes">REST API</a> or from <a href="/docs/js/guide#push-notifications-sending-pushes">Cloud Code</a>. However, push notifications can also be triggered by the existing client SDKs. If you decide to send notifications from the client SDKs, you will need to set <strong>Client Push Enabled</strong> in the Push Notifications settings of your Parse app.</p>

<p>However, be sure you understand that enabling Client Push can  lead to a security vulnerability in your app, as outlined  <a href="http://blog.parse.com/2014/09/03/the-dangerous-world-of-client-push/">on our blog</a>.  We recommend that you enable Client Push for testing purposes only,  and move your push notification logic into Cloud Code  when your app is ready to go into production.</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/client_push_settings.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can view your past push notifications on the Parse.com push console for up to 30 days after creating your push.  For pushes scheduled in the future, you can delete the push on the push console as long as no sends have happened yet. After you send the push, the push console shows push analytics graphs.</p>

<h3 id="using-channels">Using Channels</h3>

<p>The simplest way to start sending notifications is using channels. This allows you to use a publisher-subscriber model for sending pushes. Devices start by subscribing to one or more channels, and notifications can later be sent to these subscribers. The channels subscribed to by a given <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> are stored in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">channels</code> field of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> object.</p>

<h4 id="subscribing-to-channels">Subscribing to Channels</h4>

<p>A channel is identified by a string that starts with a letter and consists of alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dashes. It doesn’t need to be explicitly created before it can be used and each <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> can subscribe to any number of channels at a time.</p>

<p>Subscribing to a channel can be done using a single method call. For example, in a baseball score app, we could do:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// When users indicate they are Giants fans, we subscribe them to that channel.</span>
<span class="n">ParsePush</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">subscribeInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Giants"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>By default, the main activity for your app will be run when a user responds to notifications.</p>

<p>Once subscribed to the “Giants” channel, your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> object should have an updated <code class="highlighter-rouge">channels</code> field.</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/installation_channel.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unsubscribing from a channel is just as easy:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// When users indicate they are no longer Giants fans, we unsubscribe them.</span>
<span class="n">ParsePush</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">unsubscribeInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Giants"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also get the set of channels that the current device is subscribed to using:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">subscribedChannels</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseInstallation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentInstallation</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">getList</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"channels"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Neither the subscribe method nor the unsubscribe method blocks the thread it is called from. The subscription information is cached on the device’s disk if the network is inaccessible and transmitted to the Parse Cloud as soon as the network is usable. This means you don’t have to worry about threading or callbacks while managing subscriptions.</p>

<h4 id="sending-pushes-to-channels">Sending Pushes to Channels</h4>

<p>In the Android SDK, the following code can be used to alert all subscribers of the “Giants” channel that their favorite team just scored. This will display a notification center alert to iOS users and a system tray notification to Android users.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParsePush</span> <span class="n">push</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParsePush</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setChannel</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Giants"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setMessage</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"The Giants just scored! It's now 2-2 against the Mets."</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sendInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to target multiple channels with a single push notification, you can use a <code class="highlighter-rouge">LinkedList</code> of channels.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">LinkedList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">channels</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">LinkedList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>
<span class="n">channels</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Giants"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">channels</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Mets"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="n">ParsePush</span> <span class="n">push</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParsePush</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setChannels</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">channels</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">// Notice we use setChannels not setChannel</span>
<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setMessage</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"The Giants won against the Mets 2-3."</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sendInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="using-advanced-targeting">Using Advanced Targeting</h3>

<p>While channels are great for many applications, sometimes you need more precision when targeting the recipients of your pushes. Parse allows you to write a query for any subset of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> objects using the <a href="#queries">querying API</a> and to send them a push.</p>

<p>Since <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> is a subclass of <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, you can save any data you want and even create relationships between <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> objects and your other objects. This allows you to send pushes to a very customized and dynamic segment of your user base.</p>

<h4 id="saving-installation-data">Saving Installation Data</h4>

<p>Storing data on an <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> object is just as easy as storing <a href="#objects">any other data</a> on Parse. In our Baseball app, we could allow users to get pushes about game results, scores and injury reports.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Store app language and version</span>
<span class="n">ParseInstallation</span> <span class="n">installation</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseInstallation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentInstallation</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">installation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"scores"</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="n">installation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"injuryReports"</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">installation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">saveInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can even create relationships between your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> objects and other classes saved on Parse. To associate a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> with a particular user, for example, you can simply store the current user on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Associate the device with a user</span>
<span class="n">ParseInstallation</span> <span class="n">installation</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseInstallation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCurrentInstallation</span><span class="o">();</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<h4 id="sending-pushes-to-queries">Sending Pushes to Queries</h4>

<p>Once you have your data stored on your <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> objects, you can use a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> to target a subset of these devices. <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> queries work just like any other <a href="#queries">Parse query</a>, but we use the special static method <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseInstallation.getQuery()</code> to create it. We set this query on our <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePush</code> object, before sending the notification.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Create our Installation query</span>
<span class="n">ParseQuery</span> <span class="n">pushQuery</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseInstallation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">();</span>

<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sendInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We can even use channels with our query. To send a push to all subscribers of the “Giants” channel but filtered by those who want score update, we can do the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Create our Installation query</span>

<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sendInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If we store relationships to other objects in our <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> class, we can also use those in our query. For example, we could send a push notification to all users near a given location like this.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Find users near a given location</span>
<span class="n">ParseQuery</span> <span class="n">userQuery</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParseUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getQuery</span><span class="o">();</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="sending-options">Sending Options</h2>

<p>Push notifications can do more than just send a message. In Android, pushes can also include custom data you wish to send. You have complete control of how you handle the data included in your push notification as we will see in the <a href="#push-notifications-receiving-pushes">Receiving Notifications</a> section. An expiration date can also be set for the notification in case it is time sensitive.</p>

<h3 id="customizing-your-notifications">Customizing your Notifications</h3>

<p>If you want to send more than just a message, you will need to use a <code class="highlighter-rouge">JSONObject</code> to package all of the data. There are some reserved fields that have a special meaning in Android.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">alert</code></strong>: the notification’s message.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">uri</code></strong>: <em>(Android only)</em> an optional field that contains a URI. When the notification is opened, an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code> associated with opening the URI is launched.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code></strong>: <em>(Android, Windows 8, &amp; Windows Phone 8 only)</em> the value displayed in the Android system tray or Windows 8 toast notification.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, to send a notification that would increases the badge number by 1 and plays a custom sound, you can do the following. Note that you can set these properties from your Android client, but they would only take effect in the iOS version of your app. The badge and sound fields would have no effects for Android recipients.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">JSONObject</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">JSONObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"{\"alert\": \"The Mets scored!\",
                                   \"badge\": \"Increment\",
                                   \"sound\": \"cheering.caf\"}"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="n">ParsePush</span> <span class="n">push</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParsePush</span><span class="o">();</span>

<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setData</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sendPushInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It is also possible to specify your own data in this dictionary. As we’ll see in the <a href="#push-notifications-receiving-pushes">Receiving Notifications</a> section, you’re able to use the data sent with your push to do custom processing when  a user receives and interacts with a notification.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">JSONObject</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">JSONObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"{\"name\": \"Vaughn\",

</div>

<h3 id="setting-an-expiration-date">Setting an Expiration Date</h3>

<p>When a user’s device is turned off or not connected to the internet, push notifications cannot be delivered. If you have a time sensitive notification that is not worth delivering late, you can set an expiration date. This avoids needlessly alerting users of information that may no longer be relevant.</p>

<p>There are two methods provided by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePush</code> class to allow setting an expiration date for your notification. The first is <code class="highlighter-rouge">setExpirationTime</code> which simply takes an <code class="highlighter-rouge">time</code> (in UNIX epoch time) specifying when Parse should stop trying to send the notification.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Send push notification with expiration date</span>
<span class="n">ParsePush</span> <span class="n">push</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParsePush</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setExpirationTime</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1424841505</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setMessage</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Season tickets on sale until February 25th"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sendPushInBackground</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There is however a caveat with this method. Since device clocks are not guaranteed to be accurate, you may end up with inaccurate results. For this reason, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePush</code> class also provides the <code class="highlighter-rouge">setExpirationTimeInterval</code> method which accepts a <code class="highlighter-rouge">timeInterval</code> (in seconds). The notification will expire after the specified interval has elapsed.</p>

<h3 id="targeting-by-platform">Targeting by Platform</h3>

<p>If you build a cross platform app, it is possible you may only want to target devices of a particular operating system. Advanced Targeting allow you to filter which of these devices are targeted.</p>

<p>The following example would send a different notification to Android, iOS, and Windows users.</p>

<h2 id="scheduling-pushes">Scheduling Pushes</h2>

<p>Sending scheduled push notifications is not currently supported by the Android SDK. Take a look at the <a href="/docs/rest/guide#push-notifications-scheduling-pushes">REST API</a>, <a href="/docs/js/guide#push-notifications-scheduling-pushes">JavaScript SDK</a> or the push console on your Parse Dashboard.</p>

<h2 id="receiving-pushes">Receiving Pushes</h2>

<p>Make sure you’ve gone through the <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki/Push#quick-start">Android Push QuickStart</a> to set up your app to receive pushes.</p>

<p>When a push notification is received, the “title” is displayed in the status bar and the “alert” is displayed alongside the “title” when the user expands the notification drawer. If you choose to subclass <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.parse.ParsePushBroadcastReceiver</code>, be sure to replace that name with your class’ name in the registration.</p>

<p>Note that some Android emulators (the ones without Google API support) don’t support GCM, so if you test your app in an emulator make sure to select an emulator image that has Google APIs installed.</p>

<h3 id="customizing-notifications">Customizing Notifications</h3>

<p>Now that your app is all set up to receive push notifications, you can start customizing the display of these notifications.</p>

<h4 id="customizing-notification-icons">Customizing Notification Icons</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#notification">Android style guide</a> recommends apps use a push icon that is monochromatic and flat. The default push icon is your application’s launcher icon, which is unlikely to conform to the style guide. To provide a custom push icon, add the following metadata tag to your app’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">meta</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="nl">android:</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"com.parse.push.notification_icon"</span> <span class="nl">android:</span><span class="n">resource</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"@drawable/push_icon"</span><span class="o">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>…where <code class="highlighter-rouge">push_icon</code> is the name of a drawable resource in your package. If your application needs more than one small icon, you can override <code class="highlighter-rouge">getSmallIconId</code> in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePushBroadcastReceiver</code> subclass.</p>

<p>If your push has a unique context associated with an image, such as the avatar of the user who sent a message, you can use a large push icon to call attention to the notification. When a notification has a large push icon, your app’s static (small) push icon is moved to the lower right corner of the notification and the large icon takes its place. See the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html#NotificationUI">Android UI documentation</a> for examples. To provide a large icon, you can override <code class="highlighter-rouge">getLargeIcon</code> in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePushBroadcastReceiver</code> subclass.</p>

<h4 id="responding-with-a-custom-activity">Responding with a Custom Activity</h4>

<p>If your push has no “uri” parameter, <code class="highlighter-rouge">onPushOpen</code> will invoke your application’s launcher activity. To customize this behavior, you can override <code class="highlighter-rouge">getActivity</code> in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePushBroadcastReceiver</code> subclass.</p>

<h4 id="responding-with-a-uri">Responding with a URI</h4>

<p>If you provide a “uri” field in your push, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePushBroadcastReceiver</code> will open that URI when the notification is opened. If there are multiple apps capable of opening the URI, a dialog will displayed for the user. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePushBroadcastReceiver</code> will manage your back stack and ensure that clicking back from the Activity handling URI will navigate the user back to the activity returned by <code class="highlighter-rouge">getActivity</code>.</p>

<h3 id="managing-the-push-lifecycle">Managing the Push Lifecycle</h3>

<p>The push lifecycle has three phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A notification is received and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.parse.push.intent.OPEN</code> Intent is fired, causing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePushBroadcastReceiver</code> to call <code class="highlighter-rouge">onPushReceive</code>. If either “alert” or “title” are specified in the push, then a Notification is constructed using <code class="highlighter-rouge">getNotification</code>. This Notification uses a small icon generated using <code class="highlighter-rouge">getSmallIconId</code>, which defaults to the icon specified by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.parse.push.notification_icon</code> metadata in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code>. The Notification’s large icon is generated from <code class="highlighter-rouge">getLargeIcon</code> which defaults to null. The notification’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">contentIntent</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">deleteIntent</code> are <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.parse.push.intent.OPEN</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.parse.push.intent.DELETE</code> respectively.</li>
  <li>If the user taps on a Notification, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.parse.push.intent.OPEN</code> Intent is fired. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePushBroadcastReceiver</code> calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">onPushOpen</code>. The default implementation automatically sends an analytics event back to Parse tracking that this notification was opened. If the push contains a “uri” parameter, an activity is launched to navigate to that URI, otherwise the activity returned by <code class="highlighter-rouge">getActivity</code> is launched.</li>
  <li>If the user dismisses a Notification, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.parse.push.intent.DELETE</code> Intent is fired. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePushBroadcastReceiver</code> calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">onPushDismiss</code>, which does nothing by default</li>
</ol>

<p>All of the above methods may be subclassed to customize the way your application handles push notifications. When subclassing the methods <code class="highlighter-rouge">onPushReceive</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">onPushOpen</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">onPushDismiss</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">getNotification</code>, consider delegating to <code class="highlighter-rouge">super</code> where appropriate. For example, one might override <code class="highlighter-rouge">onPushReceive</code> to trigger a background operation for “silent” pushes and then delegate to <code class="highlighter-rouge">super</code> for all other pushes. This provides the most benefit from Parse Push and makes your code forward-compatible.</p>

<h3 id="tracking-pushes-and-app-opens">Tracking Pushes and App Opens</h3>

<p>The default implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">onPushOpen</code> will automatically track user engagment from pushes. If you choose not to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParsePushBroadcastReceiver</code> or override the <code class="highlighter-rouge">onPushOpen</code> implementation, you may need to track your app open event manually. To do this, add the following to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">onCreate</code> method of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code> or the <code class="highlighter-rouge">onReceive</code> method of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">BroadcastReceiver</code> which handles the <code class="highlighter-rouge">com.parse.push.intent.OPEN</code> Intent:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseAnalytics</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">trackAppOpened</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">getIntent</span><span class="o">());</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To track push opens, you should always pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Intent</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">trackAppOpened</code>. Passing <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">trackAppOpened</code> will track <em>only</em> a standard app-opened event, not the push-opened event. If you don’t track the push-opened event, you will not be able to use advanced analytics features such as push-open graphs and A/B testing.</p>

<p>Please be sure to set up your application to <a href="#push-notifications-installations">save the Installation object</a>. Push open tracking only works when your application’s devices are associated with saved <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installation</code> objects.</p>

<p>You can view the open rate for a specific push notification on your Parse.com push console. You can also view your application’s overall app open and push open graphs on the Parse analytics console.  Our push open analytics graphs are rendered in real time, so you can easily verify that your application is sending the correct analytics events before your next release.</p>

<h2 id="push-experiments">Push Experiments</h2>

<p>You can A/B test your push notifications to figure out the best way to keep your users engaged. With A/B testing, you can simultaneously send two versions of your push notification to different devices, and use each version’s push open rates to figure out which one is better.  You can test by either message or send time.</p>

<h3 id="ab-testing">A/B Testing</h3>

<p>Our web push console guides you through every step of setting up an A/B test.</p>

<p>For each push campaign sent through the Parse web push console, you can allocate a subset of your devices to be in the experiment’s test audience, which Parse will automatically split into two equally-sized experiment groups. For each experiment group, you can specify a different push message. The remaining devices will be saved so that you can send the winning message to them later. Parse will randomly assign devices to each group to minimize the chance for a test to affect another test’s results (although we still don’t recommend running multiple A/B tests over the same devices on the same day).</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/ios_push/experiment_enable.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After you send the push, you can come back to the push console to see in real time which version resulted in more push opens, along with other metrics such as statistical confidence interval. It’s normal for the number of recipients in each group to be slightly different because some devices that we had originally allocated to that experiment group may have uninstalled the app. It’s also possible for the  random group assignment to be slightly uneven when the test audience size is small. Since we calculate open rate separately for each group based on recipient count, this should not significantly affect your experiment results.</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/ios_push/experiment_results.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you are happy with the way one message performed, you can send that to the rest of your app’s devices (i.e. the “Launch Group”). This step only applies to A/B tests where you vary the message.</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/ios_push/experiment_launch.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Push experiments are supported on all recent Parse SDKs (iOS v1.2.13+, Android v1.4.0+, .NET v1.2.7+). Before running experiments, you must instrument your app with <a href="#push-notifications-tracking-pushes-and-app-opens">push open tracking</a>.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-statistics">Experiment Statistics</h3>

<p>Parse provides guidance on how to run experiments to achieve statistically significant results.</p>

<h4 id="test-audience-size">Test Audience Size</h4>

<p>When you setup a push message experiment, we’ll recommend the minimum size of your test audience. These recommendations are generated through simulations based on your app’s historical push open rates. For big push campaigns (e.g. 100k+ devices), this recommendation is usually small subset of your devices. For smaller campaigns (e.g. &lt; 5k devices), this recommendation is usually all devices. Using all devices for your test audience will not leave any remaining devices for the launch group, but you can still gain valuable insight into what type of messaging works better so you can implement similar messaging in your next push campaign.</p>

<h4 id="confidence-interval">Confidence Interval</h4>

<p>After you send your pushes to experiment groups, we’ll also provide a statistical confidence interval when your experiment has collected enough data to have statistically significant results. This confidence interval is in absolute percentage points of push open rate (e.g. if the open rates for groups A and B are 3% and 5%, then the difference is reported as 2 percentage points). This confidence interval is a measure of how much difference you would expect to see between the two groups if you repeat the same experiment many times.</p>

<p>Just after a push send, when only a small number of users have opened their push notifications, the open rate difference you see between groups A and B could be due to random chance, so it might not be reproducible if you run the same experiment again. After your experiment collects more data over time, we become increasingly confident that the observed difference is a true difference. As this happens, the confidence interval will become narrower, allowing us to more accurately estimate the true difference between groups A and B. Therefore, we recommend that you wait until there is enough data to generate a statistical confidence interval before deciding which group’s push is better.</p>

<h2 id="push-localization">Push Localization</h2>

<p>Localizing your app’s content is a proven way to drive greater engagement. We’ve made it easy to localize your push messages with Push Localization. The latest version of the Parse Android SDK will detect and store the user’s language in the installation object, and via the web push console you’ll be able to send localized push messages to your users in a single broadcast.</p>

<h3 id="setup-2">Setup</h3>

<p>To take advantage of  Push Localization you will need to make sure you’ve published your app with the Parse Android SDK version 1.10.1 or greater. Any users of your application running the Parse Android SDK version 1.10.1 or greater will then be targetable by Push Localization via the web push console.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that for developers who have users running apps with versions of the Parse Android SDK earlier than 1.10.1 that targeting information for Localized Push will not be available and these users will receive the default message from the push console.</p>

<h3 id="sending-a-localized-push">Sending a localized push</h3>

<p>Our web push console guides you through every step of setting up a Localized Push.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>Setting up Push Notifications is often a source of frustration for developers. The process is complicated and invites problems to happen along the way. If you run into issues, try some of these troubleshooting tips.</p>

<p>It’s important to break down the system into components when troubleshooting push notification issues. You can start by asking yourself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the push notification listed in your push logs?</li>
  <li>Are you targeting your push notification to the correct audience?</li>
  <li>Are your devices registering for push notifications?</li>
  <li>Is your app set up to receive these notifications?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the answer is Yes to all of these questions, there may be an operational issue that is affecting the delivery of push notifications. You can see the current status of the platform in our <a href="https://status.parse.com">status page</a>. If everything looks green, please <a href="https://parse.com/help#report">create a bug report</a> with more information. Every bug report opened against the push notification category will be redirected to this troubleshooting guide unless it includes evidence of having gone through these steps, so please be as verbose as possible.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure about the answer to any of the above questions, read on!</p>

<h3 id="confirm-that-the-push-campaign-was-created">Confirm that the push campaign was created</h3>

<p>Having everything set up correctly in your Parse app won’t help if your request to send a push notification does not reach Parse. The first step in debugging a push issue is to confirm that the push campaign is listed in your push logs. You can find these logs by visiting your app’s <a href="/apps">Dashboard</a> and clicking on Push.</p>

<p>If the push notification campaign is not showing up on that list, the issue is quite simple to resolve. Go back to your push notification sending code and make sure to check for any error responses. If you’re using any of the client SDKs, make sure to listen for and catch any errors that may be returned. For example, you could log errors like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">push</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sendPushInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">SendCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">done</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ParseException</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="n">Log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">d</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"push"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"The push campaign has been created."</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="n">Log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">d</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"push"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Error sending push:"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getMessage</span><span class="o">());</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Please note that SDKs that use a Client Key, such as the Android SDK, can only send push notifications if Client Push is enabled in your Parse app’s Push Notification settings. Otherwise, you’ll only be able to send pushes from the web console, the REST API, or by using the JavaScript SDK from Cloud Code. We strongly encourage developers to turn off Client Push before releasing their app publicly unless your use case allows for any amount of arbitrary pushes to be sent by any of your users. You can read our security guide for more information.</p>

<h3 id="verify-your-targeting">Verify your Targeting</h3>

<p>You have confirmed that the push notification is making it to your push logs. Now what? The next step is to verify if your push notification targeting is correct. Say, if you’re debugging why notifications are not reaching a specific device, it’s important to make sure that this device is actually included in the targeting of this push notification. You can’t deliver something that is not addressed correctly.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you’ll have to confirm that the device’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> object is included in your push notification targeting criteria. This is quite straightforward if you’re using channels: all you need to verify is that your device’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code> is subscribed to the channel by checking the channels array. If you’re using advanced targeting, e.g. you’re using a push query with constraints, you’ll have to work a bit more to determine if your targeting is on point.</p>

<p>Basically, you will need to run the same push query you’re using for your targeting, and verify that your installation of interest is included in the result set. As you can only query the installation class programmatically using the Master Key, you will need to use one of the Master Key capable SDKs (JavaScript SDK, .NET) or the REST API. Ideally, you would use the same SDK that you’re currently using to send the push notifications.</p>

<h4 id="debugging-using-the-rest-api">Debugging using the REST API</h4>

<p>The REST API is quite easy to use for this sort of purpose as you can easily recreate the push query using the information provided in your push notification logs. If you look closely at the “Full Target” value in your push campaign log item, you may notice that it matches the query format for a REST API query. You can grab an example of what a <a href="/docs/rest#queries-constraints">REST API query</a> over <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseInstallation}</code>s would look like from the REST API docs. Don’t forget to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">X-Parse-Master-Key</code> header to ensure that the Master Key is used to run this query.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Query over installations</span>
curl -X GET <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s2">"X-Parse-Application-Id: {YOUR_APPLICATION_ID}"</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s2">"X-Parse-Master-Key: {YOUR_MASTER_KEY}"</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-G <span class="se">\</span>
--data-urlencode <span class="s1">'limit=1000'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
--data-urlencode <span class="s1">'where={ "city": "San Francisco", "deviceType": { "$in": [ "ios", "android", "winphone", "embedded" ] } }'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
https://api.parse.com/1/installations
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you type the above into a console, you should be able to see the first 1,000 objects that match your query. Note that constraints are always ANDed, so if you want to further reduce the search scope, you can add a constraint that matches the specific installation for your device:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Query over installations</span>
curl -X GET <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s2">"X-Parse-Application-Id: {YOUR_APPLICATION_ID}"</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s2">"X-Parse-Master-Key: {YOUR_MASTER_KEY}"</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-G <span class="se">\</span>
--data-urlencode <span class="s1">'limit=1'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
--data-urlencode <span class="s1">'where={ “objectId”: {YOUR_INSTALLATION_OBJECT_ID}, "city": "San Francisco", "deviceType": { "$in": [ "ios", "android", "winphone", "embedded" ] } }'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
https://api.parse.com/1/installations
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If the above query returns no results, it is likely that your installation does not meet the targeting criteria for your campaign.</p>

<h3 id="check-your-device-configuration">Check your Device Configuration</h3>

<p>Your push campaign is created and the device is included in the targeting, but you’re still not receiving push notifications. What gives?</p>

<p>You can check the Push Delivery Report for the cause of failed deliveries: Mismatch Sender ID happens when the registered sender is not the same as the one currently sending the notifications, Not Registered is returned when the registration key is deemed invalid, either by misconfiguration or if the user have uninstalled the app.</p>

<p>If everything looks great so far, but push notifications are not showing up on your phone, there are a few more things you can check.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/docs/downloads">Upgrade to the latest SDK</a>. This documentation covers the push API introduced in the 1.7.0 version of the Android Parse SDK. Please upgrade if you are getting compiler errors following these instructions.</li>
  <li>Make sure you are using the correct <code class="highlighter-rouge">packageName</code> in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code>.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have the correct permissions listed in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code> file, as outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki/Push#quick-start">Android Push Quickstart</a>. If you are using a a custom receiver, be sure you have registered it in the Manifest file with the correct <code class="highlighter-rouge">android:name</code> property and the proper intent filters.</li>
  <li>Make sure you’ve used the correct App ID and client key, and that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.initialize()</code> is being called. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.initialize()</code> lets the service know which application it is listening for; this code must be in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Application.onCreate</code> rather than <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity.onCreate</code> for a particular <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code>, so that any activation technique will know how to use Parse.</li>
  <li>Check that the push registration call is being called successfully. Your device must successfully register a %{ParseInstallation} object with a valid GCM Registration id in the “deviceToken” field, if using GCM.</li>
  <li>Check that the device is set to accept push notifications from your app.</li>
  <li>Note that, by design, force-killed apps will not be able to receive push notifications. Launch the app again to reenable push notifications.</li>
  <li>Check the number of subscribers in your Parse Push Console. Does it match the expected number of subscribers? Your push might be targeted incorrectly.</li>
  <li>If testing in the emulator, try cleaning and rebuilding your project and restarting your AVD.</li>
  <li>Turn on verbose logging with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.setLogLevel(Parse.LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE)</code>. The error messages will be a helpful guide to what may be going on.</li>
  <li>If you see the message “Finished (with error)” in your Dashboard, check your verbose logs. If you are performing pushes from a device, check that client-side push is enabled in your dashboard.</li>
  <li>In your logs, you may see an error message, “Could not construct writer” or other issues related to a broken pipe. When this occurs, the framework will continue to try reconnecting. It should not crash your app.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your app has been released for a while, it is expected that a percentage of your user base will have opted out of push notifications from your app or uninstalled your app from their device. Parse does not automatically delete installation objects in either of these cases. When a push campaign is sent out, Parse will detect uninstalled installations and exclude them from the total count of push notifications sent. The recipient estimate on the push composer is based on the estimated number of installations that match your campaign’s targeting criteria. With that in mind, it is possible for the recipient estimate to be higher than the number of push notifications that is sent as reported by the push campaign status page.</p>

<h2 id="parse-config">Parse Config</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseConfig</code> is a way to configure your applications remotely by storing a single configuration object on Parse. It enables you to add things like feature gating or a simple “Message of the Day”. To start using <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseConfig</code> you need to add a few key/value pairs (parameters) to your app on the Parse Config Dashboard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/config_editor.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After that you will be able to fetch the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseConfig</code> on the client, like in this example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseConfig</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ConfigCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<h2 id="retrieving-config">Retrieving Config</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseConfig</code> is built to be as robust and reliable as possible, even in the face of poor internet connections. Caching is used by default to ensure that the latest successfully fetched config is always available. In the below example we use <code class="highlighter-rouge">getInBackground</code> to retrieve the latest version of config from the server, and if the fetch fails we can simply fall back to the version that we successfully fetched before via <code class="highlighter-rouge">getCurrentConfig</code>.</p>

<h2 id="current-config">Current Config</h2>

<p>Every <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseConfig</code> instance that you get is always immutable. When you retrieve a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseConfig</code> in the future from the network, it will not modify any existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseConfig</code> instance, but will instead create a new one and make it available via <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseConfig.getCurrentConfig()</code>. Therefore, you can safely pass around any <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseConfig</code> object and safely assume that it will not automatically change.</p>

<p>It might be troublesome to retrieve the config from the server every time you want to use it. You can avoid this by simply using the cached <code class="highlighter-rouge">getCurrentConfig</code> object and fetching the config only once in a while.</p>

<h1 id="analytics">Analytics</h1>

<p>Parse provides a number of hooks for you to get a glimpse into the ticking heart of your app. We understand that it’s important to understand what your app is doing, how frequently, and when.</p>

<p>While this section will cover different ways to instrument your app to best take advantage of Parse’s analytics backend, developers using Parse to store and retrieve data can already take advantage of metrics on Parse.</p>

<p>Without having to implement any client-side logic, you can view real-time graphs and breakdowns (by device type, Parse class name, or REST verb) of your API Requests in your app’s dashboard and save these graph filters to quickly access just the data you’re interested in.</p>

<h2 id="app-open--push-analytics">App-Open &amp; Push Analytics</h2>

<p>Our initial analytics hook allows you to track your application being launched. By adding the following line to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">onCreate</code> method of your main <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code>, you’ll begin to collect data on when and how often your application is opened.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseAnalytics</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">trackAppOpenedInBackground</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">getIntent</span><span class="o">());</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Graphs and breakdowns of your statistics are accessible from your app’s Dashboard.</p>

<p>Further analytics are available around push notification delivery and open rates. Take a look at the <a href="/docs/android/guide#push-notifications-tracking-pushes-and-app-opens">Tracking Pushes and App Opens subsection</a> of our Push Guide for more detailed information on handling notification payloads and push-related callbacks.</p>

<h2 id="custom-analytics">Custom Analytics</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseAnalytics</code> also allows you to track free-form events, with a handful of <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> keys and values. These extra dimensions allow segmentation of your custom events via your app’s Dashboard.</p>

<p>Say your app offers search functionality for apartment listings, and you want to track how often the feature is used, with some additional metadata.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Map</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dimensions</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">HashMap</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseAnalytics</code> can even be used as a lightweight error tracker — simply invoke the following and you’ll have access to an overview of the rate and frequency of errors, broken down by error code, in your application:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Map</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dimensions</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">HashMap</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>

<p>Note that Parse currently only stores the first eight dimension pairs per call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseAnalytics.trackEvent()</code>.</p>

<h1 id="user-interface">User Interface</h1>

<p>At the end of the day, users of your application will be interacting with Android UI components. We provide several UI widgets to make working with Parse data easier.</p>

<h2 id="parseloginui">ParseLoginUI</h2>

<p>If you are using Parse to manage users in your mobile app, you are already familiar with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>  class. At some point in your app, you might want to present a screen to log in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>.  Parse provides an open-source <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/ParseUI-Android">ParseLoginUI</a> library that does exactly this.  Please note ParseLoginUI is not included with the Parse Android SDK; you need to import this library from maven or from our Git repository into your project. Check the README.md of the <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/ParseUI-Android">ParseLoginUI</a> for detail steps.</p>

<p>This library contains an Android login activity that is ultra-customizable and easy to integrate with your app.  You can configure the look and feel of the login screens by either specifying XML configurations or constructing an Intent in code.  In this guide, we first provide several ways to integrate with the login library.  Then, we describe in detail how to customize the login screens.</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/android_login/all_screens.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="login-library-api">Login Library API</h2>

<h3 id="basic-integration">Basic Integration</h3>

<p>The login library integration is simple.  Our library exposes an activity-level API that lets you launch the login library activity (<code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code>) to obtain a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code> will guide the user through several screens to log in, sign up, or reset their password.  If the user resets their password by email, they are taken back to the login screen.
The user will also see helpful toast messages if they provide invalid input (e.g. logging in with an incorrect password or signing up with a username that’s already taken).</p>

<p>To include <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code> in your app, import the ParseLoginUI library project, and add the following into your <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;activity</span>
    <span class="na">android:name=</span><span class="s">"com.parse.ui.ParseLoginActivity"</span>
    <span class="na">android:label=</span><span class="s">"@string/app_name"</span>
    <span class="na">android:launchMode=</span><span class="s">"singleTop"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta-data</span>
        <span class="na">android:name=</span><span class="s">"com.parse.ui.ParseLoginActivity.PARSE_LOGIN_ENABLED"</span>
        <span class="na">android:value=</span><span class="s">"true"</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/activity&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then, you can launch <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code> from your own activity by calling:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseLoginBuilder</span> <span class="n">builder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ParseLoginBuilder</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">MyActivity</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">this</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">startActivityForResult</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">builder</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">build</span><span class="o">(),</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code> finishes, your caller activity will receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">RESULT_OK</code>: The user successfully logged in. <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseUser.getCurrentUser()</code> will be populated.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">RESULT_CANCELLED</code>: The user pressed the back button. If the user fails to log in or sign up, the only way to return to the previous screen is by pressing the back button.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve provided a sample app, <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/ParseUI-Android">ParseLoginSampleBasic</a> for this use case.  This sample app is a simple profile viewer.  If you are not logged in, <code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleProfileActivity</code> prompts you to log in.  Clicking on the login button in <code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleProfileActivity</code> launches the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code>, which prompts the user for login credentials.  If the user successfully logs in, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code> will automatically finish itself and return <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESULT_OK</code>.  Then, <code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleProfileActivity</code> will display the user’s name and a logout button.</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/android_login/basic_login.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This basic integration case works well if your caller activity is designed to function regardless of whether there is a valid current user.  For example, a restaurant reviews app may allow the user to browse restaurants even when the user is not logged in.  If the user does log in, the app could provide a more personalized experience on that same screen.</p>

<h3 id="advanced-integration">Advanced Integration</h3>

<p>If some parts or all of your app cannot function without a valid <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code>, you can protect these parts of your app with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginDispatchActivity</code> (supplied in this library project).  This dispatch activity acts like a gatekeeper; it automatically launches <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code> if no user is logged in, or launches the protected activity if a user is already logged in.  To use this, you subclass <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginDispatchActivity</code> and specify what protected activity to launch.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">SampleDispatchActivity</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="n">ParseLoginDispatchActivity</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="kd">protected</span> <span class="n">Class</span><span class="o">&lt;?&gt;</span> <span class="n">getTargetClass</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">SampleProfileActivity</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We’ve provided another sample app, <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/ParseUI-Android">ParseLoginSampleWithDispatchActivity</a> for this use case.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleProfileActivity</code> in this app cannot function without a logged-in user, so it is protected by <code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleDispatchActivity</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/android_login/login_with_dispatch.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The dispatch activity does not necessarily need to be the first activity at app launch.  You can launch the dispatch activity from any activity.  When your protected activity finishes, the dispatch activity will automatically forward the result code to your caller activity.</p>

<p>Let’s revisit the restaurant reviews app again.  You might have a comment activity that requires a user.  You can protect this activity behind a dispatch activity.  The main restaurant listing activity (supports either user or no user), can launch the dispatch activity when the user presses the comment button.  If no user is logged in, the dispatch activity will start <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code> to obtain a ParseUser.  If the user refuses to log in, they will be gracefully taken back to the restaurant listings activity.  In the restaurant listings activity, you can always call <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseUser.getCurrentUser()</code> to determine whether the user logged in.</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/android_login/restaurants_app.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="customizing-the-login-library">Customizing the Login Library</h2>

<p>There are three ways to customize the login library:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Activity metadata in <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code> - This is most recommended because it allows you to customize the login experience without writing any code, and it makes the login experience consistent regardless which activity in your app launches <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code>.</li>
  <li>In code with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginBuilder</code> - If you love writing code to do everything.</li>
  <li>Overriding layout resource XMLs - This option is useful if you want to make significant changes to the look and feel of the login experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="configure-by-activity-metadata">Configure by Activity Metadata</h3>

<p>We provide the following options for easily customizing the ParseLoginActivity in your app’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">APP_LOGO</code>: Drawable` resource for app logo.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PARSE_LOGIN_ENABLED</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Boolean</code> for whether to enable the Parse username/password login (default = false)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PARSE_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> to display on the login button (default = “Log in”)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PARSE_SIGNUP_BUTTON_TEXT</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> to display on the signup button on the login screen (default = “Sign up”)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PARSE_LOGIN_HELP_TEXT</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> to display on the password-reset link (default =  “Forgotten password”)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PARSE_LOGIN_INVALID_CREDENTIALS_TEXT</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> to show on the toast when the user login fails (default = “The username and password you entered don’t match”)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PARSE_LOGIN_EMAIL_AS_USERNAME</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Boolean</code> for whether to prompt for the user’s email as the username on the login and signup form (default = false)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PARSE_SIGNUP_MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Integer</code> for the minimum required password length on the signup form (default = 6)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PARSE_SIGNUP_SUBMIT_BUTTON_TEXT</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> to display on the submit button on the signup screen (default = “Submit”)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">FACEBOOK_LOGIN_ENABLED</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Boolean</code> for whether to show the Facebook login button (default = false)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">FACEBOOK_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> to display on the Facebook login button (default = “Log in with Facebook”)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">FACEBOOK_LOGIN_PERMISSIONS</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> array resource containing requested Facebook permissions (default = empty)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">TWITTER_LOGIN_ENABLED</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Boolean</code> for whether to show the Twitter login button (default = false)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">TWITTER_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT</code>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> to display on the Twitter login button (default = “Log in with Twitter”)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that <code class="highlighter-rouge">PARSE_LOGIN_ENABLED</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">FACEBOOK_LOGIN_ENABLED</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">TWITTER_LOGIN_ENABLED</code> are all false by default.  You need to explicitly set them to true for those components to show up on the screen.  For <code class="highlighter-rouge">APP_LOGO</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">FACEBOOK_LOGIN_PERMISSIONS</code>, make sure you use <code class="highlighter-rouge">android:resource</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">android:value</code>.</p>

<h3 id="configure-by-code">Configure by Code</h3>

<p>You can configure the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code> by code using the ParseLoginBuilder.  You specify the options on the builder, and then call <code class="highlighter-rouge">build()</code> to generate an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Intent</code> that can be used to start the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginActivity</code>.  We’ve provided a sample app, <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/ParseUI-Android">ParseLoginSampleCodeCustomization</a> demonstrating this use case.  The options in <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseLoginBuilder</code> are the same as those in activity metadata customization.  If you specify options in both code and activity metadata, the options in code take precedence.</p>

<h3 id="configure-by-overriding-layout-resource-files">Configure by Overriding Layout Resource Files</h3>

<p>You can override any layout resources by having files with the same name as those in the ParseLoginUI library project.  This is useful if you want to add a background image, or reposition the login components on the screen.  The Android build process will automatically merge resource files with the same name, giving your app project’s files precedence.   The top-level layout files are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">com_parse_ui_parse_login_fragment.xml</code>: If you do not use certain login methods (username/password, Facebook, or Twitter), you can remove the corresponding UI elements from this layout.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">com_parse_ui_parse_signup_fragment.xml</code>: You can add additional input fields in the signup form here.  If you do, you also need add code to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseSignupFragment</code> to copy that data into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> object.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">com_parse_ui_parse_login_help_fragment.xml</code>: You can change the message for password reset.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve provided another sample app, <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/ParseUI-Android">ParseLoginSampleLayoutOverride</a> showing how to do this.  This sample app only has a Facebook login button in <code class="highlighter-rouge">com_parse_ui_parse_login_fragment.xml</code>, and adds a background image to the login screens.</p>

<h2 id="parsequeryadapter">ParseQueryAdapter</h2>

<p>To display collections of data, we provide an implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Adapter</code> in the Parse Android SDK. Instead of using a basic <code class="highlighter-rouge">ListAdapter</code> backed by a static array of objects, our <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> provides a layer of abstraction and allows you to easily display data from one of your Parse classes in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">AdapterView</code> of choice (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">ListView</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">GridView</code>).</p>

<p>To use a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> to display data in an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code>, follow the steps outlined below in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code>’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">onCreate</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Instantiate a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code>.</li>
  <li>Customize it as necessary (see the below subsections for detailed instructions to display data from specific queries, change the UI of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">View</code>s to be displayed, and more).</li>
  <li>Set your new <code class="highlighter-rouge">Adapter</code> on your <code class="highlighter-rouge">AdapterView</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">setAdapter()</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the AdapterView is attached to the window, your <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> will automatically fetch the first set of data. This subclass simplifies the code that would otherwise be involved with:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pagination, with a row that can be tapped to load the next page.</li>
  <li>Configurable downloading and displaying of remote images within rows.</li>
  <li>Automatic loading and management of the Parse objects array.</li>
  <li>Callbacks from major events in the data cycle.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider the following code, which sets up a very simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> to display data in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ListView</code>. You can be up and running with a functional <code class="highlighter-rouge">ListView</code> full of data with very little configuration.</p>

</div>

<p>This view will display a list of Instruments by name. Notice all the code that we’re not writing: we can skip the logic to fetch each consecutive page of results, to manually update and maintain the backing data array, to download images in the background and set the image data on UI widgets, and to handle touch events to trigger loading the next page of results.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> can be configured to customize what data to use, how to display it, and what to do before and after it’s been fetched. Read on to see what you can do, and how to tweak a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> to fit all of your needs.</p>

<h2 id="customizing-the-query">Customizing the Query</h2>

<p>By default, the simplest <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> constructor takes a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Context</code> and a Parse class name. All <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>s in that class are then fetched and displayed in order of their <code class="highlighter-rouge">createdAt</code> timestamps.</p>

<p>To change this behavior, we drew from the functionality of an <code class="highlighter-rouge">ArrayAdapter</code>: but instead of taking in a vanilla array of objects to be displayed by the adapter, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> can also take a <code class="highlighter-rouge">QueryFactory</code> class which returns a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> you define. Pass that into the constructor, and the adapter will then use that query to determine which objects to fetch and display.</p>

<p>See below for an example setting up a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> to display only punk and metal bands with four or more members, ordered by number of records sold:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParseQueryAdapter</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ParseObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">adapter</span> <span class="o">=</span>

<h2 id="customizing-the-rows">Customizing the Rows</h2>

<p>The default layout for the individual <code class="highlighter-rouge">View</code>s in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">AdapterView</code> is a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">LinearLayout</code> with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseImageView</code> and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">TextView</code>. If <code class="highlighter-rouge">setTextKey(String)</code> is used with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code>, its parameter will be used to select which key on your <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> is displayed in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TextView</code>. Similarly, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">setImageKey(String)</code> is used, its parameter will be used to determine the image displayed in the ImageView.</p>

<p>One way to customize the rows is to override <code class="highlighter-rouge">getItemView(ParseObject, View, ViewGroup)</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">getNextPageView(View, ViewGroup)</code> and call the superclass’s implementation of the appropriate method to do the heavy lifting. If you provide your own layout to the superclass’s implementation, note that <code class="highlighter-rouge">getItemView(ParseObject, View, ViewGroup)</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">getNextPageView(View, ViewGroup)</code> expect a <code class="highlighter-rouge">TextView</code> (id: <code class="highlighter-rouge">android.R.id.text1</code>) if the <code class="highlighter-rouge">textKey</code> is set and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseImageView</code> (id: <code class="highlighter-rouge">android.R.id.icon</code>) if the <code class="highlighter-rouge">imageKey</code> is set.</p>

<p>Here, we inflate and configure a layout of our own, with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">TextView</code>, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseImageView</code>, and an extra “description” <code class="highlighter-rouge">TextView</code> (id: <code class="highlighter-rouge">R.id.description</code>):</p>

By calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">setImageKey(String)</code>, you can pass in a key name on your <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code> which should contain a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseFile}</code> containing an image to be fetched from Parse and loaded into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseImageView</code> of the corresponding row.</p>

<p>The image will download asynchronously, and the appropriate <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseImageView</code> will be updated in the background. As the user scrolls and rows are recycled by the adapter, images will be fetched as rows become visible and assigned <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>s.</p>

<p>You can define a placeholder image to be used when the image fetch has not yet completed. Call <code class="highlighter-rouge">setPlaceholder(Drawable)</code> on your <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> to use the specified <code class="highlighter-rouge">Drawable</code> as a fallback image.</p>

<h2 id="lifecycle-methods">Lifecycle Methods</h2>

<p>We expose two hooks in the data lifecycle of the Adapter for you to execute custom logic — right before we query Parse for your data and right after the fetched objects have been loaded from the query. These methods are particularly useful for toggling some loading UI.</p>

<p>An <code class="highlighter-rouge">OnQueryLoadListener</code> can be set via <code class="highlighter-rouge">setOnQueryLoadListener(OnQueryLoadListener)</code>, which provides <code class="highlighter-rouge">onLoading()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">onLoaded(List&lt;ParseObject&gt;, Exception)</code> methods for implementation.</p>

<h2 id="pagination">Pagination</h2>

<p>Pagination ensures that the table only gets one page of objects at a time. You can set the number of objects are in a page by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">setObjectsPerPage(int)</code>.</p>

<p>The query is automatically altered to apply pagination, and a pagination row appears at the bottom of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AdapterView</code> to allow users to load the next page.</p>

<p>Pagination is turned on by default. To turn it off, call <code class="highlighter-rouge">setPaginationEnabled(false)</code>. With pagination turned off, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> will use the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseQuery}</code> limit of 100 items.</p>

<h2 id="auto-loading-of-data">Auto-loading of Data</h2>

<p>When the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AdapterView</code> that your <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code> is set on is attached to a window, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseQueryAdapter</code>’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">loadObjects()</code> method is automatically called, triggering the fetching of the first page of results. To disable this behavior (perhaps to delay the fetching of data, or run some custom logic ahead of time), just call <code class="highlighter-rouge">setAutoload(false)</code> and call <code class="highlighter-rouge">loadObjects()</code> manually if autoload is disabled.</p>

<h1 id="data">Data</h1>

<p>We’ve designed the Parse SDKs so that you typically don’t need to worry about how data is saved while using the client SDKs. Simply add data to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, and it’ll be saved correctly.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are some cases where it’s useful to be aware of how data is stored on the Parse platform.</p>

<h2 id="data-storage">Data Storage</h2>

<p>Internally, Parse stores data as JSON, so any datatype that can be converted to JSON can be stored on Parse. Refer to the <a href="#objects-data-types">Data Types in Objects</a> section of this guide to see platform-specific examples.</p>

<p>Keys including the characters <code class="highlighter-rouge">$</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code>, along with the key <code class="highlighter-rouge">__type</code> key, are reserved for the framework to handle additional types, so don’t use those yourself. Key names must contain only numbers, letters, and underscore, and must start with a letter. Values can be anything that can be JSON-encoded.</p>

<h2 id="data-type-lock-in">Data Type Lock-in</h2>

<p>When a class is initially created, it doesn’t have an inherent schema defined. This means that for the first object, it could have any types of fields you want.</p>

<p>However, after a field has been set at least once, that field is locked into the particular type that was saved. For example, if a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> object is saved with field <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> of type <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code>, that field will be restricted to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> type only (the server will return an error if you try to save anything else).</p>

<p>One special case is that any field can be set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>, no matter what type it is.</p>

<h2 id="the-data-browser">The Data Browser</h2>

<p>The Data Browser is the web UI where you can update and create objects in each of your apps. Here, you can see the raw JSON values that are saved that represents each object in your class.</p>

<p>When using the interface, keep in mind the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectId</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">createdAt</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">updatedAt</code> fields cannot be edited (these are set automatically).</li>
  <li>The value “(empty)” denotes that the field has not been set for that particular object (this is different than <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>).</li>
  <li>You can remove a field’s value by hitting your Delete key while the value is selected.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Data Browser is also a great place to test the Cloud Code validations contained in your Cloud Code functions (such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">beforeSave</code>). These are run whenever a value is changed or object is deleted from the Data Browser, just as they would be if the value was changed or deleted from your client code.</p>

<h2 id="importing-data">Importing Data</h2>

<p>You may import data into your Parse app by using CSV or JSON files. To create a new class with data from a CSV or JSON file, go to the Data Browser and click the “Import” button on the left hand column.</p>

<p>The JSON format is an array of objects in our REST format or a JSON object with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">results</code> that contains an array of objects. It must adhere to the <a href="http://json.org/">JSON standard</a>. A file containing regular objects could look like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"results"</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">"score"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1337</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"playerName"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Sean Plott"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"cheatMode"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"createdAt"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"2012-07-11T20:56:12.347Z"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"updatedAt"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"2012-07-11T20:56:12.347Z"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"objectId"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"fchpZwSuGG"</span>
  <span class="p">}]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Objects in either format should contain keys and values that also satisfy the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Key names must contain only numbers, letters, and underscore, and must start with a letter.</li>
  <li>No value may contain a hard newline ‘<code class="highlighter-rouge">\n</code>’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Normally, when objects are saved to Parse, they are automatically assigned a unique identifier through the <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectId</code> field, as well as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">createdAt</code> field and <code class="highlighter-rouge">updatedAt</code> field which represent the time that the object was created and last modified in the Parse Cloud. These fields can be manually set when data is imported from a JSON file. Please keep in mind the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a unique 10 character alphanumeric string as the value of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectId</code> fields.</li>
  <li>Use a UTC timestamp in the ISO 8601 format when setting a value for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">createdAt</code> field or the <code class="highlighter-rouge">updatedAt</code> field.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the exposed fields, objects in the Parse User class can also have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bcryptPassword</code> field set. The value of this field is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> that is the bcrypt hashed password + salt in the modular crypt format described in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5882472/1351961">StackOverflow answer</a>. Most OpenSSL based bcrypt implementations should have built-in methods to produce these strings.</p>

<p>A file containing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseUser}</code> object could look like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"results"</span><span class="err">:</span>
  <span class="p">[{</span>
    <span class="s2">"username"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"cooldude"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"createdAt"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"1983-09-13T22:42:30.548Z"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"updatedAt"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"2015-09-04T10:12:42.137Z"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"objectId"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"ttttSEpfXm"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"sessionToken"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"dfwfq3dh0zwe5y2sqv514p4ib"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"bcryptPassword"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"$2a$10$ICV5UeEf3lICfnE9W9pN9.O9Ved/ozNo7G83Qbdk5rmyvY8l16MIK"</span>
  <span class="p">}]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that in CSV the import field types are limited to <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Boolean</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number</code>.</p>

<h2 id="exporting-your-data">Exporting your Data</h2>

<p>You can request an export of your data at any time from your app’s Settings page. The data export runs at a lower priority than production queries, so if your app is still serving queries, production traffic will always be given a higher priority, which may slow down the delivery of your data export.</p>

<h3 id="export-formats">Export Formats</h3>

<p>Each collection will be exported in the same JSON format used by our REST API and delivered in a single zipped file. Since data is stored internally as JSON, this allows us to ensure that the export closely matches how the data is saved to Parse. Other formats such as CSV cannot represent all of the data types supported by Parse without losing information. If you’d like to work with your data in CSV format, you can use any of the JSON-to-CSV converters available widely on the web.</p>

<h3 id="offline-analysis">Offline Analysis</h3>

<p>For offline analysis of your data, we highly recommend using alternate ways to access your data that do not require extracting the entire collection at once. For example, you can try exporting only the data that has changed since your last export. Here are some ways of achieving this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the JavaScript SDK in a node app. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.Query.each()</code> will allow you to extract every single object that matches a query. You can use date constraints to make sure the query only matches data that has been updated since you last ran this app. Your node app can write this data to disk for offline analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the REST API in a script. You can run queries against your class and use skip/limit to page through results, which can then be written to disk for offline analysis. You can again use date constraints to make sure only newly updated data is extracted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the above two options do not fit your needs, you can try using the Data Browser to export data selectively. Use the Funnel icon to create a filter for the specific data that you need to export, such as newly updated objects. Once the filter has been applied, click on the Export data icon on the upper right of your Data Browser. This type of export will only include the objects that match your criteria.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="relations">Relations</h1>

<p>There are three kinds of relationships. One-to-one relationships enable one object to be associated with another object. One-to-many relationships enable one object to have many related objects. Finally, many-to-many relationships enable complex relationships among many objects.</p>

<p>There are four ways to build relationships in Parse:</p>

<h2 id="one-to-many">One-to-Many</h2>

<p>When you’re thinking about one-to-many relationships and whether to implement Pointers or Arrays, there are several factors to consider. First, how many objects are involved in this relationship? If the “many” side of the relationship could contain a very large number (greater than 100 or so) of objects, then you have to use Pointers. If the number of objects is small (fewer than 100 or so), then Arrays may be more convenient, especially if you typically need to get all of the related objects (the “many” in the “one-to-many relationship”) at the same time as the parent object.</p>

<h3 id="using-pointers">Using Pointers</h3>

<p>Let’s say we have a game app. The game keeps track of the player’s score and achievements every time she chooses to play. In Parse, we can store this data in a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">Game</code> object. If the game becomes incredibly successful, each player will store thousands of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Game</code> objects in the system. For circumstances like this, where the number of relationships can be arbitrarily large, Pointers are the best option.</p>

<p>Suppose in this game app, we want to make sure that every <code class="highlighter-rouge">Game</code> object is associated with a Parse User. We can implement this like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-java">ParseObject game = new ParseObject("Game");
game.put("createdBy", ParseUser.getCurrentUser());
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">PFObject *game= [PFObject objectWithClassName:@"Game"];
[game setObject:[PFUser currentUser] forKey:@"createdBy"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">let game = PFObject(className:"Game")
game["createdBy"] = PFUser.currentUser()
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-php">$game = ParseObject::create("Game");
$game-&gt;set("createdBy", ParseUser::getCurrentUser());
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">var game = new ParseObject("Game");
game["createdBy"] = ParseUser.CurrentUser;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-js">var game = new Parse.Object("Game");
game.set("createdBy", Parse.User.current());
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No REST API example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>We can obtain all of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Game</code> objects created by a Parse User with a query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-java">ParseQuery&lt;ParseObject&gt; gameQuery = ParseQuery.getQuery("Game");
gameQuery.whereEqualTo("createdBy", ParseUser.getCurrentUser());
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">PFQuery *gameQuery = [PFQuery queryWithClassName:@"Game"];
[gameQuery whereKey:@"createdBy" equalTo:[PFUser currentUser]];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">let gameQuery = PFQuery(className:"Game")
if let user = PFUser.currentUser() {
  gameQuery.whereKey("createdBy", equalTo: user)
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-php">$gameQuery = new ParseQuery("Game");
$gameQuery-&gt;equalTo("createdBy", ParseUser::getCurrentUser());
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">var query = ParseObject.getQuery("Game").WhereEqualTo("createdBy", ParseUser.CurrentUser);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-js">var query = new Parse.Query("Game");
query.equalTo("createdBy", Parse.User.current());
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No REST API example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>And, if we want to find the Parse User who created a specific <code class="highlighter-rouge">Game</code>, that is a lookup on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">createdBy</code> key:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-java">// say we have a Game object
ParseObject game = ...

// getting the user who created the Game
ParseUser createdBy = game.getUser("createdBy");
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">// say we have a Game object
PFObject *game = ...

// getting the user who created the Game
PFUser *createdBy = [game objectForKey@"createdBy"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">// say we have a Game object
let game = ...

// getting the user who created the Game
let createdBy = game["createdBy"]
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-php">// say we have a Game object
$game = ...

// getting the user who created the Game
$user = $game["createdBy"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">// say we have a Game object
ParseObject game = ...

// getting the user who created the Game
ParseUser user = game["createdBy"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-js">// say we have a Game object
var game = ...

// getting the user who created the Game
var user = game.get("createdBy");
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No REST API example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>For most scenarios, Pointers will be your best bet for implementing one-to-many relationships.</p>

<h3 id="using-arrays">Using Arrays</h3>

<p>Arrays are ideal when we know that the number of objects involved in our one-to-many relationship are going to be small. Arrays will also provide some productivity benefit via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">includeKey</code> parameter. Supplying the parameter will enable you to obtain all of the “many” objects in the “one-to-many” relationship at the same time that you obtain the “one” object. However, the response time will be slower if the number of objects involved in the relationship turns out to be large.</p>

<p>Suppose in our game, we enabled players to keep track of all the weapons their character has accumulated as they play, and there can only be a dozen or so weapons. In this example, we know that the number of weapons is not going to be very large. We also want to enable the player to specify the order in which the weapons will appear on screen. Arrays are ideal here because the size of the array is going to be small and because we also want to preserve the order the user has set each time they play the game:</p>

<p>Let’s start by creating a column on our Parse User object called <code class="highlighter-rouge">weaponsList</code>.</p>

<p>Now let’s store some <code class="highlighter-rouge">Weapon</code> objects in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">weaponsList</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-java">// let's say we have four weapons

// stick the objects in an array

<p>Sometimes, we will want to fetch the “many” objects in our one-to-many relationship at the same time as we fetch the “one” object. One trick we could employ is to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">includeKey</code> (or <code class="highlighter-rouge">include</code> in Android) parameter whenever we use a Parse Query to also fetch the array of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Weapon</code> objects (stored in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">weaponsList</code> column) along with the Parse User object:</p>

<h2 id="many-to-many">Many-to-Many</h2>

<p>Now let’s tackle many-to-many relationships. Suppose we had a book reading app and we wanted to model <code class="highlighter-rouge">Book</code> objects and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Author</code> objects. As we know, a given author can write many books, and a given book can have multiple authors. This is a many-to-many relationship scenario where you have to choose between Arrays, Parse Relations, or creating your own Join Table.</p>

<p>The decision point here is whether you want to attach any metadata to the relationship between two entities. If you don’t, Parse Relation or using Arrays are going to be the easiest alternatives. In general, using arrays will lead to higher performance and require fewer queries. If either side of the many-to-many relationship could lead to an array with more than 100 or so objects, then, for the same reason Pointers were better for one-to-many relationships, Parse Relation or Join Tables will be better alternatives.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you want to attach metadata to the relationship, then create a separate table (the “Join Table”) to house both ends of the relationship. Remember, this is information <strong>about the relationship</strong>, not about the objects on either side of the relationship. Some examples of metadata you may be interested in, which would necessitate a Join Table approach, include:</p>

<h3 id="using-parse-relations">Using Parse Relations</h3>

<p>Using Parse Relations, we can create a relationship between a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Book</code> and a few <code class="highlighter-rouge">Author</code> objects. In the Data Browser, you can create a column on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Book</code> object of type relation and name it <code class="highlighter-rouge">authors</code>.</p>

<p>After that, we can associate a few authors with this book:</p>

<h3 id="using-join-tables">Using Join Tables</h3>

<p>There may be certain cases where we want to know more about a relationship. For example, suppose we were modeling a following/follower relationship between users: a given user can follow another user, much as they would in popular social networks. In our app, we not only want to know if User A is following User B, but we also want to know <strong>when</strong> User A started following User B. This information could not be contained in a Parse Relation. In order to keep track of this data, you must create a separate table in which the relationship is tracked. This table, which we will call <code class="highlighter-rouge">Follow</code>, would have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">from</code> column and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">to</code> column, each with a pointer to a Parse User. Alongside the relationship, you can also add a column with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Date</code> object named <code class="highlighter-rouge">date</code>.</p>

<p>Now, when you want to save the following relationship between two users, create a row in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Follow</code> table, filling in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">from</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">to</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">date</code> keys appropriately:</p>

ParseUser otherUser = ...

follow.put("date", Date());
follow.saveInBackground();

<h3 id="using-an-array">Using an Array</h3>

<p>Arrays are used in Many-to-Many relationships in much the same way that they are for One-to-Many relationships. All objects on one side of the relationship will have an Array column containing several objects on the other side of the relationship.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a book reading app with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Book</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Author</code> objects. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Book</code> object will contain an Array of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Author</code> objects (with a key named <code class="highlighter-rouge">authors</code>). Arrays are a great fit for this scenario because it’s highly unlikely that a book will have more than 100 or so authors. We will put the Array in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Book</code> object for this reason. After all, an author could write more than 100 books.</p>

<h2 id="one-to-one">One-to-One</h2>

<p>In Parse, a one-to-one relationship is great for situations where you need to split one object into two objects. These situations should be rare, but two examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Limiting visibility of some user data.</strong> In this scenario, you would split the object in two, where one portion of the object contains data that is visible to other users, while the related object contains data that is private to the original user (and protected via ACLs).</li>
  <li><strong>Splitting up an object for size.</strong> In this scenario, your original object is greater than the 128K maximum size permitted for an object, so you decide to create a secondary object to house extra data. It is usually better to design your data model to avoid objects this large, rather than splitting them up. If you can’t avoid doing so, you can also consider storing large data in a Parse File.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for reading this far. We apologize for the complexity. Modeling relationships in data is a hard subject, in general. But look on the bright side: it’s still easier than relationships with people.</p>

<h1 id="handling-errors">Handling Errors</h1>

<p>Many of the methods on <code class="highlighter-rouge">%{ParseObject}</code>, including <code class="highlighter-rouge">save()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">delete()</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">get()</code> will throw a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParseException</code> on an invalid request, such as deleting or editing an object that no longer exists in the cloud, or when there is a network failure preventing communication with the Parse Cloud. You will need to catch and deal with these exceptions.</p>

<p>For more details, look at the <a href="/docs/android/api/">Android API</a>.</p>

<h1 id="security-1">Security</h1>

<p>As your app development progresses, you will want to use Parse’s security features in order to safeguard data. This document explains the ways in which you can secure your apps.</p>

<p>If your app is compromised, it’s not only you as the developer who suffers, but potentially the users of your app as well. Continue reading for our suggestions for sensible defaults and precautions to take before releasing your app into the wild.</p>

<h2 id="client-vs-server">Client vs. Server</h2>

<p>When an app first connects to Parse, it identifies itself with an Application ID and a Client key (or REST Key, or .NET Key, or JavaScript Key, depending on which platform you’re using). These are not secret and by themselves they do not secure an app. These keys are shipped as a part of your app, and anyone can decompile your app or proxy network traffic from their device to find your client key. This exploit is even easier with JavaScript — one can simply “view source” in the browser and immediately find your client key.</p>

<p>This is why Parse has many other security features to help you secure your data. The client key is given out to your users, so anything that can be done with just the client key is doable by the general public, even malicious hackers.</p>

<p>The master key, on the other hand, is definitely a security mechanism. Using the master key allows you to bypass all of your app’s security mechanisms, such as <a href="#security-class-level-permissions">class-level permissions</a> and <a href="#security-object-level-access-control">ACLs</a>. Having the master key is like having root access to your app’s servers, and you should guard your master key with the same zeal with which you would guard your production machines’ root password.</p>

<p>The overall philosophy is to limit the power of your clients (using client keys), and to perform any sensitive actions requiring the master key in Cloud Code. You’ll learn how to best wield this power in the section titled <a href="#security-implementing-business-logic-in-cloud-code">Implementing Business Logic in Cloud Code</a>.</p>

<p>A final note: All connections are made with HTTPS and SSL, and Parse will reject all non-HTTPS connections. As a result, you don’t need to worry about man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>

<h2 id="class-level-permissions">Class-Level Permissions</h2>

<p>The second level of security is at the schema and data level. Enforcing security measures at this level will restrict how and when client applications can access and create data on Parse. When you first begin developing your Parse application, all of the defaults are set so that you can be a more productive developer. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A client application can create new classes on Parse</li>
  <li>A client application can add fields to classes</li>
  <li>A client application can modify or query for objects on Parse</li>
</ul>

<p>You can configure any of these permissions to apply to everyone, no one, or to specific users or roles in your app. Roles are groups that contain users or other roles, which you can assign to an object to restrict its use. Any permission granted to a role is also granted to any of its children, whether they are users or other roles, enabling you to create an access hierarchy for your apps. Each of <a href="/docs">the Parse guides</a> includes a detailed description of employing Roles in your apps.</p>

<p>Once you are confident that you have the right classes and relationships between classes in your app, you should begin to lock it down by doing the following:</p>

<p>Almost every class that you create should have these permissions tweaked to some degree. For classes where every object has the same permissions, class-level settings will be most effective. For example, one common use case entails having a class of static data that can be read by anyone but written by no one.</p>

<h3 id="restricting-class-creation">Restricting class creation</h3>

<p>As a start, you can configure your application so that clients cannot create new classes on Parse. This is done from the Settings tab on the Data Browser. Scroll down to the <strong>App Permissions</strong> section and turn off <strong>Allow client class creation</strong>. Once enabled, classes may only be created from the Data Browser. This will prevent attackers from filling your database with unlimited, arbitrary new classes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/security/client_class_creation.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="configuring-class-level-permissions">Configuring Class-Level Permissions</h3>

<p>Parse lets you specify what operations are allowed per class. This lets you restrict the ways in which clients can access or modify your classes. To change these settings, go to the Data Browser, select a class, and click the “Security” button.</p>

<p>You can configure the client’s ability to perform each of the following operations for the selected class:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Read</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Get</strong>: With Get permission, users can fetch objects in this table if they know their objectIds.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Find</strong>: Anyone with Find permission can query all of the objects in the table, even if they don’t know their objectIds. Any table with public Find permission will be completely readable by the public, unless you put an ACL on each object.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Write</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Update</strong>: Anyone with Update permission can modify the fields of any object in the table that doesn’t have an ACL. For publicly readable data, such as game levels or assets, you should disable this permission.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Create</strong>: Like Update, anyone with Create permission can create new objects of a class. As with the Update permission, you’ll probably want to turn this off for publicly readable data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Delete</strong>: With this permission, people can delete any object in the table that doesn’t have an ACL. All they need is its objectId.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add fields</strong>: Parse classes have schemas that are inferred when objects are created. While you’re developing your app, this is great, because you can add a new field to your object without having to make any changes on the backend. But once you ship your app, it’s very rare to need to add new fields to your classes automatically. You should pretty much always turn off this permission for all of your classes when you submit your app to the public.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For each of the above actions, you can grant permission to all users (which is the default), or lock permissions down to a list of roles and users. For example, a class that should be available to all users would be set to read-only by only enabling get and find. A logging class could be set to write-only by only allowing creates. You could enable moderation of user-generated content by providing update and delete access to a particular set of users or roles.</p>

<h2 id="object-level-access-control">Object-Level Access Control</h2>

<p>Once you’ve locked down your schema and class-level permissions, it’s time to think about how data is accessed by your users. Object-level access control enables one user’s data to be kept separate from another’s, because sometimes different objects in a class need to be accessible by different people. For example, a user’s private personal data should be accessible only to them.</p>

<p>Parse also supports the notion of anonymous users for those apps that want to store and protect user-specific data without requiring explicit login.</p>

<p>When a user logs into an app, they initiate a session with Parse. Through this session they can add and modify their own data but are prevented from modifying other users’ data.</p>

<h3 id="access-control-lists">Access Control Lists</h3>

<p>The easiest way to control who can access which data is through access control lists, commonly known as ACLs. The idea behind an ACL is that each object has a list of users and roles along with what permissions that user or role has. A user needs read permissions (or must belong to a role that has read permissions) in order to retrieve an object’s data, and a user needs write permissions (or must belong to a role that has write permissions) in order to update or delete that object.</p>

<p>Once you have a User, you can start using ACLs. Remember: Users can be created through traditional username/password signup, through a third-party login system like Facebook or Twitter, or even by using Parse’s <a href="/docs/ios/guide#users-anonymous-users">automatic anonymous users</a> functionality. To set an ACL on the current user’s data to not be publicly readable, all you have to do is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-objc">PFUser *user = [PFUser currentUser];
user.ACL = [PFACL ACLWithUser:user];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">if let user = PFUser.currentUser() {
    user.ACL = PFACL(user: user)
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">ParseUser user = ParseUser.getCurrentUser();
user.setACL(new ParseACL(user));
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-js">var user = Parse.User.current();
user.setACL(new Parse.ACL(user));
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">var user = ParseUser.CurrentUser;
user.ACL = new ParseACL(user);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-php">$user = ParseUser::getCurrentUser();
$user-&gt;setACL(new ParseACL($user))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No command line example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>Most apps should do this. If you store any sensitive user data, such as email addresses or phone numbers, you need to set an ACL like this so that the user’s private information isn’t visible to other users. If an object doesn’t have an ACL, it’s readable and writeable by everyone. The only exception is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_User</code> class. We never allow users to write each other’s data, but they can read it by default. (If you as the developer need to update other <code class="highlighter-rouge">_User</code> objects, remember that your master key can provide the power to do this.)</p>

<p>To make it super easy to create user-private ACLs for every object, we have a way to set a default ACL that will be used for every new object you create:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-objc">[PFACL setDefaultACL:[PFACL ACL] withAccessForCurrentUser:YES];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">PFACL.setDefaultACL(PFACL(), withAccessForCurrentUser: true)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">ParseACL.setDefaultACL(new ParseACL(), true);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-js">// not available in the JavaScript SDK

<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">// not available in the .NET SDK

</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No command line example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the user to have some data that is public and some that is private, it’s best to have two separate objects. You can add a pointer to the private data from the public one.</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-objc">PFObject *privateData = [PFObject objectWithClassName:@"PrivateUserData"];
privateData.ACL = [PFACL ACLWithUser:[PFUser currentUser]];
[privateData setObject:@"555-5309" forKey:@"phoneNumber"];

[[PFUser currentUser] setObject:privateData forKey:@"privateData"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">if let currentUser = PFUser.currentUser() {
    let privateData = PFObject(className: "PrivateUserData")
    privateData.ACL = PFACL(user: currentUser)
    privateData.setObject("555-5309", forKey: "phoneNumber")
    currentUser.setObject(privateData, forKey: "privateData")
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">ParseObject privateData = new ParseObject("PrivateUserData");
privateData.setACL(new ParseACL(ParseUser.getCurrentUser()));
privateData.put("phoneNumber", "555-5309");

ParseUser.getCurrentUser().put("privateData", privateData);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-js">var privateData = Parse.Object.extend("PrivateUserData");
privateData.setACL(new Parse.ACL(Parse.User.current()));
privateData.set("phoneNumber", "555-5309");

Parse.User.current().set("privateData", privateData);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">var privateData = new ParseObject("PrivateUserData");
privateData.ACL = new ParseACL(ParseUser.CurrentUser);
privateData["phoneNumber"] = "555-5309";

ParseUser.CurrentUser["privateData"] =  privateData;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-php">$privateData = ParseObject::create("PrivateUserData");
$privateData-&gt;setACL(new ParseACL(ParseUser::getCurrentUser()));
$privateData-&gt;set("phoneNumber", "555-5309");

</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No command line example

<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example

<p>Of course, you can set different read and write permissions on an object. For example, this is how you would create an ACL for a public post by a user, where anyone can read it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-objc">PFACL *acl = [PFACL ACL];
[acl setPublicReadAccess:true];
[acl setWriteAccess:true forUser:[PFUser currentUser]];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">let acl = PFACL()
acl.setPublicReadAccess(true)
if let currentUser = PFUser.currentUser() {
    acl.setWriteAccess(true, forUser: currentUser)
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">ParseACL acl = new ParseACL();

<p>Sometimes it’s inconvenient to manage permissions on a per-user basis, and you want to have groups of users who get treated the same (like a set of admins with special powers). Roles are are a special kind of object that let you create a group of users that can all be assigned to the ACL. The best thing about roles is that you can add and remove users from a role without having to update every single object that is restricted to that role. To create an object that is writeable only by admins:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-objc">// Assuming you've already created a role called "admins"...
PFACL *acl = [PFACL ACL];
[acl setPublicReadAccess:true];
[acl setWriteAccess:true forRoleWithName:@"admins"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">let acl = PFACL()
acl.setPublicReadAccess(true)
acl.setWriteAccess(true, forRoleWithName: "admins")
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">// Assuming you've already created a role called "admins"...
ParseACL acl = new ParseACL();
acl.setPublicReadAccess(true);
acl.setRoleWriteAccess("admins", true);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-js">var acl = new Parse.ACL();
acl.setPublicReadAccess(true);
acl.setRoleWriteAccess("admins", true);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">var acl = new ParseACL();
acl.PublicReadAccess = true;
acl.SetRoleWriteAccess("admins", true);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-php">$acl = new ParseACL();
$acl-&gt;setPublicReadAccess(true);
$acl-&gt;setRoleWriteAccessWithName("admins", true);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No command line example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this snippet assumes you’ve already created a role named “admins”. This is often reasonable when you have a small set of special roles set up while developing your app. Roles can also be created and updated on the fly — for example, adding new friends to a “friendOf___” role after each connection is made.</p>

<p>All this is just the beginning. Applications can enforce all sorts of complex access patterns through ACLs and class-level permissions. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For private data, read and write access can be restricted to the owner.</li>
  <li>For a post on a message board, the author and members of the “Moderators” role can have “write” access, and the general public can have “read” access.</li>
  <li>For logging data that will only be accessed by the developer through the REST API using the master key, the ACL can deny all permissions.</li>
  <li>Data created by a privileged group of users or the developer, like a global message of the day, can have public read access but restrict write access to an “Administrators” role.</li>
  <li>A message sent from one user to another can give “read” and “write” access just to those users.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the curious, here’s the format for an ACL that restricts read and write permissions to the owner (whose <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectId</code> is identified by <code class="highlighter-rouge">"aSaMpLeUsErId"</code>) and enables other users to read the object:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nt">"*"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">"read"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nt">"aSaMpLeUsErId"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">"read"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">:</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">"write"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>And here’s another example of the format of an ACL that uses a Role:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nt">"role:RoleName"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">"read"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nt">"aSaMpLeUsErId"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">"read"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">"write"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="pointer-permissions">Pointer Permissions</h3>

<p>Pointer permissions are a special type of class-level permission that create a virtual ACL on every object in a class, based on users stored in pointer fields on those objects. For example, given a class with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">owner</code> field, setting a read pointer permission on <code class="highlighter-rouge">owner</code> will make each object in the class only readable by the user in that object’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">owner</code> field. For a class with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">sender</code> and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">reciever</code> field, a read pointer permission on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">receiver</code> field and a read and write pointer permission on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sender</code> field will make each object in the class readable by the user in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sender</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">receiver</code> field, and writable only by the user in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sender</code> field.</p>

<p>Given that objects often already have pointers to the user(s) that should have permissions on the object, pointer permissions provide a simple and fast solution for securing your app using data which is already there, that doesn’t require writing any client code or cloud code.</p>

<p>Pointer permissions are like virtual ACLs. They don’t appear in the ACL column, buf if you are familiar with how ACLs work, you can think of them like ACLs. In the above example with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sender</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">receiver</code>, each object will act as if it has an ACL of:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nt">"&lt;SENDER_USER_ID&gt;"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nt">"read"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nt">"write"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nt">"&lt;RECEIVER_USER_ID&gt;"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nt">"read"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that this ACL is not actually created on each object. Any existing ACLs will not be modified when you add or remove pointer permissions, and any user attempting to interact with an object can only interact with the object if both the virtual ACL created by the pointer permissions, and the real ACL already on the object allow the interaction. For this reason, it can sometimes be confusing to combine pointer permissions and ACLs, so we recommend using pointer permissions for classes that don’t have many ACLs set. Fortunately, it’s easy to remove pointer permissions if you later decide to use Cloud Code or ACLs to secure your app.</p>

<h3 id="clp-and-acl-interaction">CLP and ACL interaction</h3>

<p>Class-Level Permissions (CLPs) and Access Control Lists (ACLs) are both powerful tools for securing your app, but they don’t always interact exactly how you might expect. They actually represent two separate layers of security that each request has to pass through to return the correct information or make the intended change. These layers, one at the class level, and one at the object level, are shown below. A request must pass through BOTH layers of checks in order to be authorized. Note that despite acting similarly to ACLs, <a href="#security-pointer-permissions">Pointer Permissions</a> are a type of class level permission, so a request must pass the pointer permission check in order to pass the CLP check.</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/security/clp_vs_acl_diagram.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see, whether a user is authorized to make a request can become complicated when you use both CLPs and ACLs. Let’s look at an example to get a better sense of how CLPs and ACLs can interact. Say we have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Photo</code> class, with an object, <code class="highlighter-rouge">photoObject</code>. There are 2 users in our app, <code class="highlighter-rouge">user1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">user2</code>. Now lets say we set a Get CLP on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Photo</code> class, disabling public Get, but allowing <code class="highlighter-rouge">user1</code> to perform Get. Now let’s also set an ACL on <code class="highlighter-rouge">photoObject</code> to allow Read - which includes GET - for only <code class="highlighter-rouge">user2</code>.</p>

<p>You may expect this will allow both <code class="highlighter-rouge">user1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">user2</code> to Get <code class="highlighter-rouge">photoObject</code>, but because the CLP layer of authentication and the ACL layer are both in effect at all times, it actually makes it so <em>neither</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">user1</code> nor <code class="highlighter-rouge">user2</code> can Get <code class="highlighter-rouge">photoObject</code>. If <code class="highlighter-rouge">user1</code> tries to Get <code class="highlighter-rouge">photoObject</code>, it will get through the CLP layer of authentication, but then will be rejected because it does not pass the ACL layer. In the same way, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">user2</code> tries to Get <code class="highlighter-rouge">photoObject</code>, it will also be rejected at the CLP layer of authentication.</p>

<p>Now lets look at example that uses Pointer Permissions. Say we have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> class, with an object, <code class="highlighter-rouge">myPost</code>. There are 2 users in our app, <code class="highlighter-rouge">poster</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">viewer</code>. Lets say we add a pointer permission that gives anyone in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Creator</code> field of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> class read and write access to the object, and for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">myPost</code> object, <code class="highlighter-rouge">poster</code> is the user in that field. There is also an ACL on the object that gives read access to <code class="highlighter-rouge">viewer</code>. You may expect that this will allow <code class="highlighter-rouge">poster</code> to read and edit <code class="highlighter-rouge">myPost</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">viewer</code> to read it, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">viewer</code> will be rejected by the Pointer Permission, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">poster</code> will be rejected by the ACL, so again, neither user will be able to access the object.</p>

<p>Because of the complex interaction between CLPs, Pointer Permissions, and ACLs, we recommend being careful when using them together. Often it can be useful to use CLPs only to disable all permissions for a certain request type, and then using Pointer Permissions or ACLs for other request types. For example, you may want to disable Delete for a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Photo</code> class, but then put a Pointer Permission on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Photo</code> so the user who created it can edit it, just not delete it. Because of the especially complex way that Pointer Permissions and ACLs interact, we usually recommend only using one of those two types of security mechanisms.</p>

<h3 id="security-edge-cases">Security Edge Cases</h3>

<p>There are some special classes in Parse that don’t follow all of the same security rules as every other class. Not all classes follow <a href="#security-classes">Class-Level Permissions (CLPs)</a> or <a href="#security-objects">Access Control Lists (ACLs)</a> exactly how they are defined, and here those exceptions are documented. Here “normal behavior” refers to CLPs and ACLs working normally, while any other special behaviors are described in the footnotes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Logging in, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">/1/login</code> in the REST API, does not respect the Get CLP on the user class. Login works just based on username and password, and cannot be disabled using CLPs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Retrieving the current user, or becoming a User based on a session token, which are both <code class="highlighter-rouge">/1/users/me</code> in the REST API, do not respect the Get CLP on the user class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read ACLs do not apply to the logged in user. For example, if all users have ACLs with Read disabled, then doing a find query over users will still return the logged in user. However, if the Find CLP is disabled, then trying to perform a find on users will still return an error.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create CLPs also apply to signing up. So disabling Create CLPs on the user class also disables people from signing up without the master key.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users can only Update and Delete themselves. Public CLPs for Update and Delete may still apply. For example, if you disable public Update for the user class, then users cannot edit themselves. But no matter what the write ACL on a user is, that user can still Update or Delete itself, and no other user can Update or Delete that user. As always, however, using the master key allows users to update other users, independent of CLPs or ACLs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get requests on installations follow ACLs normally. Find requests without master key is not allowed unless you supply the <code class="highlighter-rouge">installationId</code> as a constraint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Update requests on installations do adhere to the ACL defined on the installation, but Delete requests are master-key-only. For more information about how installations work, check out the <a href="/docs/rest#installations">installations section of the REST guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="data-integrity-in-cloud-code">Data Integrity in Cloud Code</h2>

<p>For most apps, care around keys, class-level permissions, and object-level ACLs are all you need to keep your app and your users’ data safe. Sometimes, though, you’ll run into an edge case where they aren’t quite enough. For everything else, there’s <a href="https://parse.com/docs/cloudcode/guide#cloud-code">Cloud Code</a>.</p>

<p>Cloud Code allows you to upload JavaScript to Parse’s servers, where we will run it for you. Unlike client code running on users’ devices that may have been tampered with, Cloud Code is guaranteed to be the code that you’ve written, so it can be trusted with more responsibility.</p>

<p>One particularly common use case for Cloud Code is preventing invalid data from being stored. For this sort of situation, it’s particularly important that a malicious client not be able to bypass the validation logic.</p>

<p>To create validation functions, Cloud Code allows you to implement a <code class="highlighter-rouge">beforeSave</code> trigger for your class. These triggers are run whenever an object is saved, and allow you to modify the object or completely reject a save. For example, this is how you create a <a href="https://parse.com/docs/cloudcode/guide#cloud-code-beforesave-triggers">Cloud Code beforeSave trigger</a> to make sure every user has an email address set:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">Parse</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Cloud</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">beforeSave</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Parse</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">User</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">request</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">object</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"email"</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Every user must have an email address."</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">success</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Our <a href="https://parse.com/docs/cloudcode/guide#cloud-code">Cloud Code guide</a> provides instructions on how to upload this trigger to our servers.</p>

<p>Validations can lock down your app so that only certain values are acceptable. You can also use <code class="highlighter-rouge">afterSave</code> validations to normalize your data (e.g. formatting all phone numbers or currency identically). You get to retain most of the productivity benefits of accessing Parse data directly from your client applications, but you can also enforce certain invariants for your data on the fly.</p>

<p>Common scenarios that warrant validation include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Making sure phone numbers have the right format</li>
  <li>Sanitizing data so that its format is normalized</li>
  <li>Making sure that an email address looks like a real email address</li>
  <li>Requiring that every user specifies an age within a particular range</li>
  <li>Not letting users directly change a calculated field</li>
  <li>Not letting users delete specific objects unless certain conditions are met</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementing-business-logic-in-cloud-code">Implementing Business Logic in Cloud Code</h2>

<p>While validation often makes sense in Cloud Code, there are likely certain actions that are particularly sensitive, and should be as carefully guarded as possible. In these cases, you can remove permissions or the logic from clients entirely and instead funnel all such operations to Cloud Code functions.</p>

<p>When a Cloud Code function is called, it can invoke the <code class="highlighter-rouge">useMasterKey</code> function to gain the ability to modify user data. With the master key, your Cloud Code function can override any ACLs and write data. This means that it’ll bypass all the security mechanisms you’ve put in place in the previous sections.</p>

<p>Say you want to allow a user to “like” a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> object without giving them full write permissions on the object. You can do this by having the client call a Cloud Code function instead of modifying the Post itself:</p>

<p>The master key should be used carefully. When invoked, the master key is in effect for the duration of the Cloud Code function in which it is called:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">Parse</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Cloud</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">define</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"like"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">Parse</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Cloud</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">useMasterKey</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="c1">// Everything after this point will bypass ACLs and other security</span>
  <span class="c1">// even if I do things besides just updating a Post object.</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A more prudent way to use the master key would be to pass it as a parameter on a per-function basis. For example, instead of the above, set <code class="highlighter-rouge">useMasterKey</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> in each individual API function:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">Parse</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Cloud</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">define</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"like"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>One very common use case for Cloud Code is sending push notifications to particular users. In general, clients can’t be trusted to send push notifications directly, because they could modify the alert text, or push to people they shouldn’t be able to. Your app’s settings will allow you to set whether “client push” is enabled or not; we recommend that you make sure it’s disabled. Instead, you should write Cloud Code functions that validate the data to be pushed and sent before sending a push.</p>

<h2 id="parse-security-summary">Parse Security Summary</h2>

<p>Parse provides a number of ways for you to secure data in your app. As you build your app and evaluate the kinds of data you will be storing, you can make the decision about which implementation to choose.</p>

<p>It is worth repeating that that the Parse User object is readable by all other users by default. You will want to set the ACL on your User object accordingly if you wish to prevent data contained in the User object (for example, the user’s email address) from being visible by other users.</p>

<p>Most classes in your app will fall into one of a couple of easy-to-secure categories. For fully public data, you can use class-level permissions to lock down the table to put publicly readable and writeable by no one. For fully private data, you can use ACLs to make sure that only the user who owns the data can read it. But occasionally, you’ll run into situations where you don’t want data that’s fully public or fully private. For example, you may have a social app, where you have data for a user that should be readable only to friends whom they’ve approved. For this you’ll need to a combination of the techniques discussed in this guide to enable exactly the sharing rules you desire.</p>

<p>We hope that you’ll use these tools to do everything you can   to keep your app’s data and your users’ data secure.   Together, we can make the web a safer place.</p>

<h1 id="performance">Performance</h1>

<p>As your app scales, you will want to ensure that it performs well under increased load and usage. There are parts of optimizing performance that Parse takes care of but there are some things you can do. This document provides guidelines on how you can optimize your app’s performance. While you can use Parse for quick prototyping and not worry about performance, you will want to keep our performance guidelines in mind when you’re initially designing your app. We strongly advise that you make sure you’ve followed all suggestions before releasing your app.</p>

<p>Parse provides services out of the box to help your app scale auto-magically. On top of our MongoDB datastore, we have built an API layer that seamlessly integrates with our client-side SDKs. Our cloud infrastructure uses online learning algorithms to automatically rewrite inefficient queries and generate database indexes based on your app’s realtime query stream.</p>

<p>In addition to what Parse provides, you can improve your app’s performance by looking at the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing efficient queries.</li>
  <li>Writing restrictive queries.</li>
  <li>Using client-side caching.</li>
  <li>Using Cloud Code.</li>
  <li>Avoiding count queries.</li>
  <li>Using efficient search techniques.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that not all suggestions may apply to your app. Let’s look into each one of these in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="write-efficient-queries">Write Efficient Queries</h2>

<p>Parse objects are stored in a database. A Parse query retrieves objects that you are interested in based on conditions you apply to the query. To avoid looking through all the data present in a particular Parse class for every query, the database can use an index. An index is a sorted list of items matching a given criteria. Indexes help because they allow the database to do an efficient search and return matching results without looking at all of the data. Indexes are typically smaller in size and available in memory, resulting in faster lookups.</p>

<h2 id="smart-indexing">Smart Indexing</h2>

<p>The key to writing efficient queries is understanding our indexing strategy. If your data is not indexed, every query will have to go through the the entire data for a class to return a query result. On the other hand, if your data is indexed appropriately, the number of documents scanned to return a correct query result should be low.</p>

<p>One of the advantages to using Parse if that you don’t have to worry about managing your own database and maintaining indexes. We’ve built an abstraction to manage all that complexity. However, you do have to organize your data model and use performant queries to take advantage of this. To better understand how to go about doing this, you need to understand how our systems are operating behind the abstraction. The key strategy you will want to understand here is our use of smart indexing.</p>

<p>Smart indexing means that we algorithmically generate indexes for the apps that we host. The sheer number of apps hosted on Parse means that we cannot manually generate indexes for each app. This would not scale well as developers can change their schemas or query patterns at any time. This is why we rely on smart indexes.</p>

<p>We perform two types of index creation logic. The first generates simple (single field) indexes for each API request, and the second does offline processing to pick good compound indexes based on real API traffic patterns. In each case the goal is to pick indexes that result in the smallest search space for the query, that is, there will be less data to scan to find results.</p>

<p>The simple indexing strategy looks at every API request and attempts to pick good indexes based on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The query constraint’s likelihood of providing the smallest search space.</li>
  <li>The number of possible values a field may have based on its data type. We consider data types with a larger number of possible values to have a higher entropy.</li>
</ul>

<p>The order of a query constraint’s usefulness is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Equal to</li>
  <li>Contained In</li>
  <li>Less than, Less than or Equal to, Greater than, Greater than or Equal to</li>
  <li>Prefix string matches</li>
  <li>Not equal to</li>
  <li>Not contained in</li>
  <li>Everything else</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a look at the following query to retrieve GameScore objects:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">var GameScore = Parse.Object.extend("GameScore");
var query = new Parse.Query(GameScore);
query.equalTo("score", 50);
query.containedIn("playerName",
    ["Jonathan Walsh", "Dario Wunsch", "Shawn Simon"]);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">PFQuery *query = [PFQuery queryWithClassName:@"GameScore"];
[query whereKey:@"score" equalTo:@50];
[query whereKey:@"playerName"
    containedIn:@[@"Jonathan Walsh", @"Dario Wunsch", @"Shawn Simon"]];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">let query = PFQuery.queryWithClassName("GameScore")
query.whereKey("score", equalTo: 50)
query.whereKey("playerName", containedIn: ["Jonathan Walsh", "Dario Wunsch", "Shawn Simon"])
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">ParseQuery&lt;ParseObject&gt; query = ParseQuery.getQuery("GameScore");
query.whereEqualTo("score", 50);
query.whereContainedIn("playerName", Arrays.asList("Jonathan Walsh", "Dario Wunsch", "Shawn Simon"));
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">var names = new[] { "Jonathan Walsh", "Dario Wunsch", "Shawn Simon" };
var query = new ParseObject.GetQuery("GameScore")
    .WhereEqualTo("score", 50)
    .WhereContainedIn("playerName", names);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No REST API example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>Creating an index query based on the score field would yield a smaller search space in general than creating one on the playerName field.</p>

<p>When examining data types, booleans have a very low entropy and and do not make good indexes. Take the following query constraint:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">query.equalTo("cheatMode", false);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">[query whereKey:@"cheatMode" equalTo:@NO];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">query.whereKey("cheatMode", equalTo: false)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">query.whereEqualTo("cheatMode", false);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">query.WhereEqualTo("cheatMode", false);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No REST API example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>The two possible values for <code class="highlighter-rouge">"cheatMode"</code> are <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>. If an index was added on this field it would be of little use because it’s likely that 50% of the records will have to be looked at to return query results.</p>

<p>We also throw out relations and join tables, since no values are stored for these keys. We heavily promote GeoPoints since MongoDB won’t run a geo query without a geo index. Other data types are ranked by their expected entropy of the value space for the key:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Array</li>
  <li>Pointer</li>
  <li>Date</li>
  <li>String</li>
  <li>Number</li>
  <li>Other</li>
</ul>

<p>We score each query according to the above metrics, and make sure we create a unique index on the three top-scoring fields for each query. For a compound query that consists of an OR of subqueries, we compute the top three indexes for each subquery.</p>

<p>Even the best indexing strategy can be defeated by suboptimal queries. You will need to design queries that work hand in hand with smart indexing to deliver performant apps.</p>

<h2 id="efficient-query-design">Efficient Query Design</h2>

<p>Writing efficient queries means taking full advantage of indexes. Let’s take a look at some query constraints that negate the use of indexes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not Equal To</li>
  <li>Not Contained In</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the following queries under certain scenarios may result in slow query responses if they can’t take advantage of indexes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regular Expressions</li>
  <li>Ordered By</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="not-equal-to">Not Equal To</h3>

<p>For example, let’s say you’re tracking high scores for a game in a GameScore class. Now say you want to retrieve the scores for all players except a certain one. You could create this query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">var GameScore = Parse.Object.extend("GameScore");
var query = new Parse.Query(GameScore);
query.notEqualTo("playerName", "Michael Yabuti");
query.find().then(function(results) {
  // Retrieved scores successfully
});
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">PFQuery *query = [PFQuery queryWithClassName:@"GameScore"];
[query whereKey:@"playerName" notEqualTo:@"Michael Yabuti"];
[query findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlock:^(NSArray *objects, NSError *error) {
  if (!error) {
    // Retrieved scores successfully
  }
}];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">let query = PFQuery.queryWithClassName("GameScore")
query.whereKey("playerName", notEqualTo: "Michael Yabuti")
query.findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlock {
  (objects, error) in
  if !error {
    // Retrieved scores successfully
  }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">ParseQuery&lt;ParseObject&gt; query = ParseQuery.getQuery("GameScore");
query.whereNotEqualTo("playerName", "Michael Yabuti");
query.findInBackground(new FindCallback&lt;ParseObject&gt;() {
  @Override
  public void done(List&lt;ParseObject&gt; list, ParseException e) {
    if ( e == null) {
      // Retrieved scores successfully
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">var results = await ParseObject.GetQuery("GameScore")
    .WhereNotEqualTo("playerName", "Michael Yabuti")
    .FindAsync();
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No REST API example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>This query can’t take advantage of indexes. The database has to look at all the objects in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">"GameScore"</code> class to satisfy the constraint and retrieve the results. As the number of entries in the class grows, the query takes longer to run.</p>

<p>Luckily, most of the time a “Not Equal To” query condition can be rewritten as a “Contained In” condition. Instead of querying for the absence of values, you ask for values which match the rest of the column values. Doing this allows the database to use an index and your queries will be faster.</p>

<p>For example if the User class has a column called state which has values “SignedUp”, “Verified”, and “Invited”, the slow way to find all users who have used the app at least once would be to run the query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">var query = new Parse.Query(Parse.User);
query.notEqualTo("state", "Invited");
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">PFQuery *query = [PFUser query];
[query whereKey:@"state" notEqualTo:@"Invited"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">var query = PFUser.query()
query.whereKey("state", notEqualTo: "Invited")
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">ParseQuery&lt;ParseUser&gt; query = ParseQuery.getQuery(ParseUser.class);

<p>It would be faster to use the “Contained In” condition when setting up the query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-objc">[query whereKey:@"state"

<p>Sometimes, you may have to completely rewrite your query. Going back to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">"GameScore"</code> example, let’s say we were running that query to display players who had scored higher than the given player. We could do this differently, by first getting the given player’s high score and then using the following query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">var GameScore = Parse.Object.extend("GameScore");
var query = new Parse.Query(GameScore);
// Previously retrieved highScore for Michael Yabuti
query.greaterThan("score", highScore);
query.find().then(function(results) {
  // Retrieved scores successfully

<p>The new query you use depends on your use case. This may sometimes mean a redesign of your data model.</p>

<h3 id="not-contained-in">Not Contained In</h3>

<p>Similar to “Not Equal To”, the “Not Contained In” query constraint can’t use an index. You should try and use the complementary “Contained In” constraint. Building on the User example, if the state column had one more value, “Blocked”, to represent blocked users, a slow query to find active users would be:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">var query = new Parse.Query(Parse.User);
query.notContainedIn("state", ["Invited", "Blocked"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">PFQuery *query = [PFUser query];

<p>Using a complimentary “Contained In” query constraint will always be faster:</p>

</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No REST API example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>This means rewriting your queries accordingly. Your query rewrites will depend on your schema set up. It may mean redoing that schema.</p>

<h3 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>Most regular expression queries in Parse are heavily throttled due to performance considerations. MongoDB is not efficient for doing partial string matching except for the special case where you only want a prefix match. Queries that have regular expression constraints are therefore very expensive, especially for classes with over 100,000 records. Parse restricts how many such operations can be run on a particular app at any given time.</p>

<p>You should avoid using regular expression constraints that don’t use indexes. For example, the following query looks for data with a given string in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">"playerName"</code> field. The string search is case insensitive and therefore cannot be indexed:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">query.matches("playerName", "Michael", “i”);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">[query whereKey:@"playerName" matchesRegex:@"Michael" modifiers:@"i"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">query.whereKey("playerName", matchesRegex: "Michael", modifiers: "i")
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">query.whereMatches("playerName", "Michael", "i");
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">query.WhereMatches("playerName", "Michael", "i")
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No REST API example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>The following query, while case sensitive, looks for any occurrence of the string in the field and cannot be indexed:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">query.contains("playerName", "Michael");
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">[query whereKey:@"playerName" containsString:@"Michael"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">query.whereKey("playerName", containsString: "Michael")
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">query.whereContains("playerName", "Michael");
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">query.WhereContains("playerName", "Michael")
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No REST API example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>These queries are both slow. In fact, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">matches</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">contains</code> query constraints are not covered in our querying guides on purpose and we do not recommend using them. Depending on your use case, you should switch to using the following constraint that uses an index, such as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">query.startsWith("playerName", "Michael");
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">[query whereKey:@"playerName" hasPrefix:@"Michael"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">query.whereKey("playerName", hasPrefix: "Michael")
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">query.whereStartsWith("playerName", "Michael");
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">query.WhereStartsWith("playerName", "Michael")
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No REST API example
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>This looks for data that starts with the given string. This query will use the backend index, so it will be faster even for large datasets.</p>

<p>As a best practice, when you use regular expression constraints, you’ll want to ensure that other constraints in the query reduce the result set to the order of hundreds of objects to make the query efficient. If you must use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">matches</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">contains</code> constraints for legacy reasons, then use case sensitive, anchored queries where possible, for example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">query.matches("playerName", "^Michael");
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">[query whereKey:@"playerName" matchesRegex:@"^Michael"];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">query.whereKey("playerName", matchesRegex: "^Michael")
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">query.whereMatches("playerName", "^Michael");
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">query.WhereMatches("playerName", "^Michael")
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-bash"># No REST API example

<pre><code class="language-common-cpp">// No C++ example
</code></pre>

<p>Most of the use cases around using regular expressions involve implementing search. A more performant way of implementing search is detailed later.</p>

<h2 id="write-restrictive-queries">Write Restrictive Queries</h2>

<p>Writing restrictive queries allows you to return only the data that the client needs. This is critical in a mobile environment were data usage can be limited and network connectivity unreliable. You also want your mobile app to appear responsive and this is directly affected by the objects you send back to the client. The <a href="https://www.parse.com/docs/js/guide#queries">Querying Guide</a> shows the types of constraints you can add to your existing queries to limit the data returned. When adding constraints, you want to pay attention and design efficient queries.</p>

<p>You can limit the number of query results returned. The limit is 100 by default but anything from 1 to 1000 is a valid limit:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">query.limit(10); // limit to at most 10 results
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">query.limit = 10; // limit to at most 10 results
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">query.limit = 10 // limit to at most 10 results
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">query.setLimit(10); // limit to at most 10 results

<p>If you’re issuing queries on GeoPoints, make sure you specify a reasonable radius:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">var query = new Parse.Query(PlaceObject);
query.withinMiles("location", userGeoPoint, 10.0);
query.find().then(function(placesObjects) {
  // Get a list of objects within 10 miles of a user's location

<h2 id="client-side-caching">Client-side Caching</h2>

<p>For queries run from iOS and Android, you can turn on query caching. See the <a href="/docs/ios/guide#queries-caching-queries">iOS</a> and <a href="/docs/android/guide#queries-caching-queries">Android</a> guides for more details. Caching queries will increase your mobile app’s performance especially in cases where you want to display cached data while fetching the latest data from Parse.</p>

<h2 id="use-cloud-code">Use Cloud Code</h2>

<p>Cloud Code allows you to run custom JavaScript logic on Parse instead of on the client.</p>

<p>You can use this to off load processing to the Parse servers thus increasing your app’s perceived performance.  You can create hooks that run whenever an object is saved or deleted. This is useful if you want to validate or sanitize your data. You can also use Cloud Code to modify related objects or kick off other processes such as sending off a push notification. There are time limits to how long Cloud Code can run, for example an <code class="highlighter-rouge">afterSave</code> hook only has 3 seconds to run. You can use Background Jobs if you need to run more time consuming processes such as data migrations.</p>

<p>We saw examples of limiting the data returned by writing restrictive queries. You can also use <a href="/docs/cloudcode/guide#cloud-code-cloud-functions">Cloud Functions</a> to help limit the amount of data returned to your app. In the following example, we use a Cloud Function to get a movie’s average rating:</p>

<span class="p">});</span>

</div>

<p>You could have ran a query on the Review class on the client, returned only the stars field data and computed the result on the client. As the number of reviews for a movie increases you can see that the data being returned to the device using this methodology also increases. Implementing the functionality through a Cloud Function returns the one result if successful.</p>

<p>As you look at optimizing your queries, you’ll find that you may have to change the queries - sometimes even after you’ve shipped your app to the App Store or Google Play. The ability to change your queries without a client update is possible if you use <a href="/docs/cloudcode/guide#cloud-code-cloud-functions">Cloud Functions</a>. Even if you have to redesign your schema, you could make all the changes in your Cloud Functions while keeping the client interface the same to avoid an app update. Take the average stars Cloud Function example from before, calling it from a client SDK would look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-command-js">Parse.Cloud.run("averageStars", { "movie": "The Matrix" }).then(function(ratings) {

<h2 id="avoid-count-operations">Avoid Count Operations</h2>

<p>For classes with over 1,000 objects, count operations are limited by timeouts. They may routinely yield timeout errors or return results that are only approximately correct. Thus, it is preferable to architect your application to avoid this count operation.</p>

<p>Suppose you are displaying movie information in your app and your data model consists of a Movie class and a Review class that contains a pointer to the corresponding movie. You might want to display the review count for each movie on the top-level navigation screen using a query like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">var Review = Parse.Object.extend("Review");
var query = new Parse.Query("Review");
// movieId corresponds to a given movie's id
query.equalTo(“movie”, movieId);
query.count().then(function(count) {
  // Request succeeded
});
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-objc">PFQuery *query = [PFQuery queryWithClassName:@"Review"];
// movieId corresponds to a given movie's id
[query whereKey:@"movie" equalTo:movieId];
[query countObjectsInBackgroundWithBlock:^(int number, NSError *error) {
  if (!error) {
    // Request succeeded
  }
}];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-swift">let query = PFQuery.queryWithClassName("Review")
// movieId corresponds to a given movie's id
query.whereKey("movie", equalTo: movieId)
query.countObjectsInBackgroundWithBlock {
  (number, error) in
  if !error {
    // Request succeeded
  }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-java">ParseQuery&lt;ParseObject&gt; query = ParseQuery.getQuery("Review");
// movieId corresponds to a given movie's id
query.whereEqualTo("movie", movieId);
query.countInBackground(new CountCallback() {
  @Override
  public void done(int i, ParseException e) {
    if ( e == null) {
      // Request succeeded
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-common-csharp">var count = await ParseObject.GetQuery("Review")

<p>If you run the count query for each of the UI elements, they will not run efficiently on large data sets. One approach to avoid using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">count()</code> operator could be to add a field to the Movie class that represents the review count for that movie. When saving an entry to the Review class you could increment the corresponding movie’s review count field. This can be done in an <code class="highlighter-rouge">afterSave</code> handler:</p>

<p>You could also use a separate Parse Object to keep track of counts for each review. Whenever a review gets added or deleted, you can increment or decrement the counts in an <code class="highlighter-rouge">afterSave</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">afterDelete</code> Cloud Code handler. The approach you choose depends on your use case.</p>

<h2 id="implement-efficient-searches">Implement Efficient Searches</h2>

<p>As mentioned previously, MongoDB is not efficient for doing partial string matching. However, this is an important use case when implementing search functionality that scales well in production.</p>

<p>Simplistic search algorithms simply scan through all the class data and executes the query on each entry. The key to making searches run efficiently is to minimize the number of data that has to be examined when executing each query by using an index as we’ve outlined earlier. You’ll need to build your data model in a way that it’s easy for us to build an index for the data you want to be searchable. For example, string matching queries that don’t match an exact prefix of the string won’t be able to use an index leading to timeout errors as the data set grows.</p>

<p>Let’s walk through an example of how you could build an efficient search. You can apply the concepts you learn in this example to your use case. Say your app has users making posts, and you want to be able to search those posts for hashtags or particular keywords. You’ll want to pre-process your posts and save the list of hashtags and words into array fields. You can do this processing either in your app before saving the posts, or you can use a Cloud Code <code class="highlighter-rouge">beforeSave</code> hook to do this on the fly:</p>

</div>

<p>This saves your words and hashtags in array fields, which MongoDB will store with a multi-key index. There are some important things to notice about this. First of all it’s converting all words to lower case so that we can look them up with lower case queries, and get case insensitive matching. Secondly, it’s filtering out common words like ‘the’, ‘in’, and ‘and’ which will occur in a lot of posts, to additionally reduce useless scanning of the index when executing the queries.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got the keywords set up, you can efficiently look them up using “All” constraint on your query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-common-js">var Post = Parse.Object.extend("Post");
var query = new Parse.Query(Post);
query.containsAll("hashtags", [“#parse”, “#ftw”]);

<h2 id="limits-and-other-considerations">Limits and Other Considerations</h2>

<p>There are some limits in place to ensure the API can provide the data you need in a performant manner. We may adjust these in the future. Please take a moment to read through the following list:</p>

<p><strong>Objects</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Parse Objects are limited in size to 128 KB.</li>
  <li>We recommend against creating more than 64 fields on a single Parse Object to ensure that we can build effective indexes for your queries.</li>
  <li>We recommend against using field names that are longer than 1,024 characters, otherwise an index for the field will not be created.</li>
  <li>An app may only create up to 100 Parse Config keys. Use Parse Objects if you need more.</li>
  <li>An app may only create up to 200 classes.</li>
  <li>Only the first 100 classes will be displayed in the Data Browser.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Queries</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Queries return 100 objects by default. Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">limit</code> parameter to change this, up to a value of 1,000.</li>
  <li>Queries can only return up to 1,000 objects in a single result set. This includes any resolved pointers. You can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">skip</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">limit</code> to page through results.</li>
  <li>The maximum value accepted by <code class="highlighter-rouge">skip</code> is 10,000. If you need to get more objects, we recommend sorting the results and then using a constraint on the sort column to filter out the first 10,000 results. You will then be able to continue paging through results starting from a <code class="highlighter-rouge">skip</code> value of 0. For example, you can sort your results by <code class="highlighter-rouge">createdAt ASC</code> and then filter out any objects older than the <code class="highlighter-rouge">createdAt</code> value of the 10,000th object when starting again from 0.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, you may use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">each()</code> method in the JavaScript SDK to page through all objects that match the query.</li>
  <li>Skips and limits can only be used on the outer query.</li>
  <li>You may increase the limit of a inner query to 1,000, but skip cannot be used to get more results past the first 1,000.</li>
  <li>Constraints that collide with each other will result in only one of the constraint being applied. An example of this would be two <code class="highlighter-rouge">equalTo</code> constraints over the same key with two different values, which contradicts itself (perhaps you’re looking for ‘contains’).</li>
  <li>Regular expression queries are deprecated and an app can make no more than 80 regex queries / minute.</li>
  <li>Count operations are limited to 160 count queries / minute period for each application.  The limit applies to all requests made by all clients of the application. If you need to query counts more frequently, you may want to design your system so the results can be cached in your client application.</li>
  <li>No geo-queries inside compound OR queries.</li>
  <li>Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">$exists: false</code> is not advised.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">each</code> query method in the JavaScript SDK cannot be used in conjunction with queries using geo-point constraints.</li>
  <li>A maximum of 500,000 objects will be scanned per query. If your constraints do not successfully limit the scope of the search, this can result in queries with incomplete results.</li>
  <li>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">containsAll</code> query constraint can only take up to 9 items in the comparison array.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Files</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Parse Files are limited to 10 MB each and the limit cannot be increased. There is no limit on how many Parse Files your app can create.</li>
  <li>Parse Hosting, on the other hand, supports files up to 500 MB, ideal for Unity projects.</li>
  <li>Parse Files cannot be accessed via HTTPS.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Push Notifications</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>An app can upload up to 6 APNs certificates.</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ApplePushService.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH100-SW1">Delivery of notifications is a “best effort”, not guaranteed</a>. It is not intended to deliver data to your app, only to notify the user that there is new data available.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cloud Code</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>JavaScript scripts in Cloud Code are limited to 128 KB.</li>
  <li>Cloud functions must return within 15 seconds. Use webhooks if you need more time.</li>
  <li>Cloud save/delete hooks must return within 3 seconds. Use webhooks if you need more time.</li>
  <li>Background jobs will be terminated after 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Cloud Code invocations (such as functions, save/delete hooks, background jobs, and custom endpoint handlers) must use a finite amount of memory (currently 384 MB, but subject to change in the future). This memory is garbage collected by the JavaScript engine, so it is generally not an issue. To allow the garbage collector to do its work, make sure that you aren’t saving references to large objects, HTTP response buffers, and other objects to global variables in your script.</li>
  <li>Webhooks must return within 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Apps can run one job concurrently by default, but this can be increased by increasing your requests/second in your <a href="/account">Account Overview</a> page.</li>
  <li>Additional background jobs over quota will fail to run. They will not be queued.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">params</code> payload that is passed to a Cloud Function is limited to 50 MB.</li>
  <li>When using <code class="highlighter-rouge">console</code> to log information and errors, the message string will be limited to 1 KB.</li>
  <li>Only the first 100 messages logged by a Cloud function will be persisted in the Cloud Code logs.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.Cloud.httpRequest</code> has a 2 second connection timeout. If the connection cannot be established within 2 seconds, you may see a 124 request timed out error.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.Cloud.httpRequest</code> has a maximum total timeout of 1 minute. This timeout can be further restricted by the maximum timeout of the particular Cloud Code invocation. For instance, before/after save triggers have a maximum timeout of 3 seconds, so the maximum timeout for an HTTP request made within a before/after save trigger is 3 seconds.</li>
  <li>There is a limit of 8 concurrent outbound <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parse.Cloud.httpRequest</code> requests per Cloud Code request.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="error-codes">Error Codes</h1>

<p>The following is a list of all the error codes that can be returned by the Parse API. You may also refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">RFC2616</a> for a list of http error codes. Make sure to check the error message for more details.</p>
